3990512_0	Try blocking the distractions as much as possible.
3990512_1	For one thing, focus on what you want to achieve or what you are supposed to be doing at the moment. Eliminate all distractions.  Concentration is a discipline of the mind so it does take practice especially since we have so many distractions these days.  Try meditation to improve your concentration.
3990512_2	sorry.... i don't know the answer. . But if you are student, 'concentrate' on studies & don't ask childish questions.

332116_1	Get lots of restful sleep.  Poor concentration is usually a result of not getting enough sleep or good sleep, which means 8+ hours of uninterrupted sleep.  Sleep disorders like sleep apnea causes things like lack of concentration or sleepiness during the day.
3154563_3	Heat causes particles to move from a place of greater concentration to a place of lesser concentration..            e.g. Glass of water sitting in the hot sun..                     The water will evapourate

3149758_0	Diffusion is when solutes go from a higher concentration to a lower concentration through a membrane. Osmosis, on the other hand, is when water diffuses through a semi-permeable membrane from a higher concentration to a lower concentration.
3239083_1	an osmolarity detector would detect the overall concentration of solution, although it's typically used for physiological salt concentrations (157 mM, etc.).
248974_2	With concentration, you would do something like this.

3253458_0	because sea water has a salt concentration in it, and it is corrosive, similar to an acid but not as destructive. and saltwater will kill plant life harming the surrounding enviroment. they do but they also have salt water filters on the firboats to help bring the salt concentration down.
1949736_1	WATER IS NOT MOVED BY ACTIVE TRANSPORT!!! Water is moved by Osmosis (diffusion of water molecules through a selectively permeable membrance DOWN a concentration gradient). Active Tansport requires Adenosine Tri-Phosphate or simply ATP molecules. Energy is used to move particles FROM area where they are in LOW concentration to area where they are HIGH in concentration. AGAINST a concentration gradient. USUALLY through a Transport Protien! active transport is AGAINST the Concentration gradient!
1949736_5	active transport:. the movement of dissolved substances across a cell membrane that requires energy to move against the concentration gradient from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration

3579785_0	because it goes against the concentration gradient (goes from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration). It is a common example of active transport.
55529_0	If you rinse the buret with distilled water, when you add the NaOH to it, there may still be water left in the buret, thus, diluting the concentration of the NaOH solution.  This would give you a lower molarity of NaOH than if you rinsed the buret with NaOH solution because mixing NaOH with NaOH (if they are both identical in concentration) would not change the concentration.
3656872_7	When they test the hair, yes you fail but they look for the concentration of the drug. They may not fail you completely but the chances aren't good if you are going for a job. When in this drug training seminar they taught us about the % concentration and what is acceptable and what is not. If they concentration is low then you may be fine good luck.

1860702_0	A Hypotonic solution is one in which the concentration of electrolyte is below that in cells. In this situation osmotic pressure leads to the migration of water into the cells, in an attempt to equalize the electrolyte concentration inside and outside the cell walls. If the difference in concentration is significant, the cell walls may rupture, leading to the death of the cell. Consequently, it is vital that the electrolyte concentration of liquids used during blood transfusions be matched to that in cells.
1860702_1	In biology, a hypotonic cell environment is an environment with a lower concentration of solutes than the cytoplasm of the cell. In a hypotonic environment, osmosis causes a net flow of water into the cell, causing the swelling and expansion of the cell. This swelling may lead to the bursting of the cell.. . In summary, a hypertonic solution contains a higher concentration compared to the cell. Hypotonic means it has a lower concentration compared to the cell. Isotonic is a situation in which the concentrations of the cell and of the solution are in an equal ratio.

3270641_1	It is a form of Active transport.  Diffusion is the spread of a substance from a gradient of higher concentration to that of a lower concentration.  Facilitated simply means that the diffusion is assisted or sped up
3749223_0	It is because the ph is calculated by taking the -log of the concentration of Hydrogen. For example if the concentration of Hydrogen is 1x10-7 M, the pH would be 7. If you increase the concentration of hydrogen by adding more acid, like making the solution contain 1x10-3 M, the pH would be 3. It continues to follow this pattern and even can go negative.

1182425_0	It is usually expressed as the concentration of the solute in water.  Phrased this way, one would say that the concentration of a given solute rises as you add more of it to a given amount of water.
2800339_2	ADH does not directly affect potassium concentrations, rather aldosterone does that. ADH could affect potassium concentrations in the same way that it affects other constituents of urine, in that it regulates the amount of water in the urine. More ADH would lead to less water in the urine, giving you a higher concentration of potassium, as well as higher concentrations of everything else.
311770_2	just like and enjoy the work you do, concentration will come automatically
4359089_0	Density is how much 'stuff' is packed into a certain space (volume).. Concentration is almost the same, but it kind of means "density level".. If the concentration of a substance determines the density.. . Good luck!

1173778_0	If the mole of HCl is unkonwn, u ll need a pH meter o something else to determine the pH of the solution first.. By using the formula:. pH = -log(concentration of H+). then u can get the concentration of H+. HCl is strong acid, so the concentration of H+ equals to the concentrtion of HCl
