1166941_1	Some people believe that if there is a sick person indoors, opening an umbrella indoors will make them sicker. Strangely, it is not considered to bring an already open umbrella in and leaving it open to dry.. Like many superstitions, like walking under a ladder or breaking a mirror, it probably boils down to safety and common sense. Walk under a ladder and you could knock it and the person on it down. Open an umbrella inside and you could break something or poke somebody's eye out!

2855289_1	The purpose of laboratory testing of seed germination is to assess seed quality or viability and to predict performance of the seed and seedling in the field. Seed processed for sale must be tested by a qualified laboratory under the Association of Official Seed Analysts Rules for testing seeds. Several different kinds of testing are available depending on the type of seed to be tested, the conditions of the test, and the potential uses of the seed. The most common tests are the warm germination test, cold germination test, accelerated aging test, and the tetrazolium test. Each test is designed to evaluate various qualities of the seed. Factors that can affect the performance of seed in germination tests include; diseased seed, old seed, mechanically damaged seed, seed stored under high moisture, and excessive heating of seed during storage or drying. In most cases a seed treatment will improve germination of seed only if the poor quality is due to seed-borne disease. . . The most common test is a warm germination test because it is required by seed laws to appear on the label. The percentage of germinating seed in a warm germination test must be printed on the label of the seed if it is to be sold as seed. Germination is defined as: "the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions." The warm germination test reflects the stand producing potential of a seed lot under ideal planting conditions. Usually 400 seed from each seed lot are placed under moist conditions on blotters, rolled towels, or sand and maintained at 77 degrees F for about seven days. At the end of this period the seedlings are categorized as normal, abnormal, or diseased, and dead or hard seeds. The percentage germination is calculated from the number of normal seedlings from the total number of seeds evaluated. . . The cold germination test is designed to measure the ability of seeds to germinate under high soil-moisture content and low soil temperature. This vigor test simulates early season adverse field conditions and usually represents the lowest germination that would be expected from a seed lot planted under such conditions. Actual field germination would normally fall between the cold test result and that of the warm germination test. Seeds are planted in a sand-soil mix at high moisture content and maintained at 50 degrees F for seven days. The test is then placed at 77 degrees F for four days. The percentage of healthy seedlings that emerge at least one inch above the soil is reported. . . The accelerated aging test estimates the carryover potential of a seed lot in warehouse storage. The seeds are exposed to high temperatures and high relative humidity for short periods of time that cause seed deterioration. Seed are suspended over water in a chamber for 72 hours (wheat and soybeans) or 96 hours (corn) then tested in a standard warm germination test. This test only would be used on seed whose longevity was in question. . . The tetrazolium test is a "quick test" for seed lot viability. It is useful when an approximate germination percentage is needed immediately. Seeds are soaked overnight in water then treated with tetrazolium to give an indication of viable, abnormal, and dead seeds in the seed lot. This test will not detect seed-borne disease, thus is limited in its ability to estimate seed quality. This test is highly reliable for determining viable seed of corn, wheat, oats, barley, and other grasses. . . If growers wish to use bin-run seed and has not had a germination test conducted by a competent laboratory, they can get an approximate germination test using the following procedure in their own home. . . Place two paper towels in the bottom of a dish or tray, one on top of the other; wet the towels thoroughly and tilt the tray up on one end so that excess water runs off the tray.

3025260_1	They both have the same basic belief system and worship the same thing.. The Catholics have much more dogmatic law.  And they also have the pope.  Catholicism states that the pope is a direct conduit to God and whatever he says in infallible.  The rest of Christianity thinks that's kind of ridiculous.
993930_4	The court system is set up to protect the innocent. It isn't perfect as no human made systems are ever perfect. Justice demands both that those who violate laws be punished and that those who are law abiding and innocent of crimes remain free. This requires a huge resource to ensure that the innocent are rightly protected while the guilty is rightly punished. Law enforcement, lawyers, judges, juries, laws written by the legislature, past court cases, etc. . . The goal is to protect the innocent and punish the guilty, how would you do this?
993930_6	even when 100 criminals dont get their deserved punishment, not even an inncocent should be punished. This is the basic concept behind all laws. Thus obviously there will be loopholes.

1351675_3	Well, since the mecahnics are trying to replace the inspection stickers by using some kind of tool, it's best to have an uncracked windshield, eventhough the crack doesn't interfere with your road viewing. They can try to take off the old sticker with a cracked windshield but if not careful, results can be messy. Hopefully, this is helpful.

641980_0	Interstates in all states were originally built in the 1950s under President Eisenhower as a means to provide reliable roads for high speed transit that could handle heavy vehicles (e.g. Tanks) that were unsuitable for other existing long distance roads, as well as provide for safer long distance civilian travel and commercial traffic.   While many of these highways are "interstates" that connect one state to another, they were all built as part of the same highway system plan.
641980_3	Interstate, while literally meaning "between states", is merely the largest class of highway in the country.  Were a road between two states called an interstate, there would be thousands of smaller roads denoted as interstate.. . In short, it's just a name for a big highway.

4047045_0	I am not Dominican or Mexican, but here is my best guess: In general Mexicans are at a lower socioeconomic status than Dominicans. Since the average Caucasian American can't tell the difference between Dominicans and Mexicans (like the way some people say all Asians look alike), Dominicans are often mistaken for Mexicans, and feel that they are treated with less respect because people assume they are Mexican and poor.. . P.S. Not my belief, I believe people should be treated as INDIVIDUALS, not as Dominican, Mexican, Asian, Caucasian, rich or poor, but this is our society...

However, some Taco Bell serve their own pizza (not that mexican pizza thing) and they use some of the ingrediants (the crust, cheese and toppings) from Pizza Hut and some that are unique to Taco Bell (the sauce and spices).
3245196_5	For a number of reasons-poor upbringing, just plain rude, but I think the number one reason is that people are just too self centered and self absorbed. Plus most people don't say anything about it, so the rude ones get so used to this behavior they don't realize how big of jerks they are being.Try pointing out their rudeness to them sometimes. I was shopping a few weeks ago and a woman asked me if I knew where a certain section was. I told her then she just walked off! I hollered after her that she was welcome. She hesitated and kind of ducked her head, which I think was caused by her realizing how rude her actions were. It may be wishful thinking, but I don't think so. I have no problem pointing out the rudeness of others to them and most become embarassed because they realize exactly how rude they are being. If more people would be nicer, we could bring back politeness. Kill 'em with kindness!!

2556570_2	I've heard that yawning is contagious, because of pressure in your ears. When someone yawns it changes the pressure in the room enough to make your ears want to adjust.
1551287_3	Water normally boils at 100ºC,which means it´s has the energy to push the atmosferic pressure. If the water is free to escape, it will not get hotter than 100ºC.  But if its trapped with no contact of atmosferic pressure, you can get water as hot as you want.

I am a church leader myself, and in my tradition we always worship on Sunday, and we always worship on Christmas.  So, my church will be open.

82028_1	An airplane flies due to the aerodynamic reactions that happen when air passes at high speed over the wing.. . If you look at a cross-section of an airplane wing, you will see that the top of the wing is curved, while the bottom of the wing is straight -- or at least curved less than the top. This shape -- called an airfoil -- is what creates lift when a wing travels through the air.

1254390_1	i usually season chicken with some salt, black pepper, maybe some bread crumbs. then in a cast iron skillet, i add at least 4-5 tablespoons of canola oil, the pan has to heat up-when dip chicken in oil-it will sizzle and then i cover with steel mesh splatter shield to prevent oil from jumping. and keeping eye on the chicken, turning each piece over and over so that the pieces will turn nice golden brown. the meat inside must not be too pink, but white, so as to not get sick from salmonella bacteria.
1254390_2	Well I like to soak my chicken pieces in a little brine that I make up at least 30 minutes but a couple of hours is better.  Fill your deep fryer to the full line with the oil of your choice.  I recommend peanut or canola.  Set the deep fryer to 350 degrees.  Drop your chicken in and cook until a nice golden brown, it should float to the top when it's done.  Oh yeah for my brine I use a combination of buttermilk, cayenne, garlic powder, and of course salt.  You still want to add a litt salt and pepper to your flour you coat your chicken in though.  Hope this helps.

4473331_0	Potty train your rabbit to live in the house.  It may take a bit of work, but then your bunny will live happily ever after away from the cold.
4473331_1	Potty train her using a cat litter box, but do not use cat litter cuz bunnies eat some of their poop.  Instead use hay or newspaper.  Since you have a girl you don't have to worry about her spraying the walls around the litter box (a problem we had with my boy).  Just continue to put her in the box when she poops and pees.  Also, put some of her poop in the box the first time to help her. Always leave a little of the previous waste in the box when you empty it to help her remember where to go.  We kept ours in the bathroom so we had one litter box.  If you are going to let her hop around the whole house you will need a litter box in almost every room to begin with so that she can become trained.  Also, you want to be careful that cords are tied up out of her way so that she won't chew on them.  Our bunny chewed the baseboard around our bathroom.  You might want to spray it with bitter apple to keep the bunny from chewing on it or other things that are low.  Good luck and have fun.  If wonderful having a bunny hope around your feet while your in the house.
4473331_2	put them inside large cardboard boxes with small small holes or vents for air to enter and leave.
4473331_3	Actually, there are a lot of considerations to think about when bringing a bunny indoors.  Personally, I think it is a much better environment for them, but you need to understand that they may not immediately take to your surroundings the way you would like.  Firstly, there is the cage training/litter training thing.  Rabbits are naturally neat creatures and therefore are fairly easy to train.  The key is patience.  Also, if your rabbit has not been spayed, you might want to have this done as it will make potty training easier.  My suggestion is to line a cat litter pan with newspaper, then cover that in hay.  This will give the bunny a reason to go into the pan in the first place, as well as something to dig around in to cover up their "business" when they are done.  . . Another important thing to consider is chewing.  Because a rabbit's teeth are constantly growing, they chew to keep them ground down.  Make sure your bun has plenty of safe chew toys to play with.  Mine  love cardboard boxes, telephone books, wooden bird toys, and baby teething keys.  One thing to remember is that wires and the like are often found at floor level, making them a convenient place for a bun to chew.  Not only is this bad for your home electronics, it can give your rabbit a nasty shock too!  Your local electronics store should have some good, sturdy cable wraps to tuck away such temptations.  . . You should also think about restricting your rabbit's access to carpeted areas of the house.  Often rabbits will attempt to graze on carpet, which of course, destroys the rug in question, and can also make the rabbit sick.  Some rabbits never have this problem, and others are seemingly impossible to break from it, so it's all about trying things out with your bun, and seeing what works for you both.  . . If you have any specific questions about bunny training, or keeping house rabbits, feel free to e-mail me (hmelton@sbcglobal.net) anytime.  I currently have 3 sweet little buns living in my house, and have kept indoor rabbits for years.  . . Hope this helps -- and check out the site listed below for some good reading on the subject!

The pole of a magenet that seeks the south pole is the north pole and vis. versa.  So, what we call the "North Pole" is actually the pole that is attracted to actual north pole, which is on the bottom of the earth.
1949989_0	The main similarity is in the so-called investigation techniques.  In both instances, once someone was accused they were interrogated until they revealed the names of others who were cohorts or suspect.  In both instances, once you revealed some names - genuine or not - you were free to go, but refusing to play ball got you incarcerated.. . Obviously, the witch trials were a little more violent in nature - while there were some isolated instances of torture and execution under McCarthyism, in comparison nearly every interrogation in the witch trials included it.

1262670_2	Gladerade is correct:. . Felony - Can be punished by incarceration more than a year.  The typingig and classing of felonies varies from state to state.. . Misdemeanor - Maximum possible sentence less than a year.  Of course commiting a misdemeanor and being convicted of one does not necessarily mean a person will do any jail time.  May get community service and a fine, for example for many low level misdemeanors.  The classification is based on maximum possible sentence.. . An offence or violation (i.e. most traffic infractions) are not misdemeanors or felonies and thus are NOT crimes.  So if you have a job application asking you whether you have been convicted of a crime and you have an 80 mph in a 65 zone on your record, etc., you can truthfully answer NO.

4065263_4	Actuaries for  Insurance companies calculate how likely it it is for some event to happen. Using these statistics they cna they figure out how much to charge so that they stiil make money on all of their policies. Some policies will have a claim and some will not. Essentially, it is like gambling. Just like the Casino, the house always wins in the long run. While some people will collect more than they paid in premiums, like some of the BlackJack or slot playes will win, most will not.. . As a consumer, you have to understand the risk of beeing uninsured vs. the cost of your premium. In some cases you don't get a choice i.e. auto insurance requuired by the government and house insurance required by the bank that holds your mortgage,. . In others, say dental insurance , you might decide that since you have never needed any thing other than a cleaning, you will not take the insurance and take the risk that next toime you could need three fillings.
4065263_6	Great question.  Insurance companies exist to make a profit. And, if your accident / insurance usage is below average, you wouldn't techincally need them. (Of course, for auto insurance, it's usually mandated by state law, so be sure to follow the law).. . Insurance companies make a profit by calculating the expected payouts/claims based on a lot of factors, including history, projections, etc... and then make sure that they charge more than they expect to pay out in premiums. The premiums of course are adjusted for higher risk groups. . . In the end, slightly over half the people insured willl pay more to an insurance company than they recieve, and slightly less than half will get more money from the insurance company than they pay in premiums.  . . Insurance companies, like banks, also invest your premiums to get a better return on your money.. . It's a real science, and insurance companies pay huge bucks to the people responsible for setting premiums and writing those alogrithms.

197598_5	Homo is a prefix that means same.
197598_8	homo means same (homosexual, homogeneous, etc.). the prefix also means man (homosapien). . ok, I'm editing, because I can see there's gonna be a problem here LOL homo is a prefix used commonly in biology.  It is both the Latin prefix for "man" and the Greek prefix for "same" - since the question was in the biology category and when taking my own bio classes I ran into it more often in the Greek sense, that was my first answer.  In the word "homosexual" (which has become quite the fixation on this site lately...) it is the Greek definition which is used; "homosexual" translates to "same sex"... hope that clarifies
2333098_2	Its a one eyed monster in greek mythology
3679240_1	if she's out by herself it maybe that she's not use to being alone outside. Try taking her out for short periods of time alone. Say a half hour at first and leave her alone. If she starts barking ignore her. If you have a window where you can check up on her just see if something is out there. If not just leave her be. After a while she'll realize that it's okay to be outside alone.
779966_0	Actually the McLaren F1's record has been broken by a couple of cars, one the Spyker something or other, and the current record holder, the Bugatti Veyron, at 248.5 MPH.  Nowhere close to being as sexy as the F1, however.. . Of course, there are speed record cars way faster, but I assume you're asking about street cars, not specialized drag or salt flats cars.

900046_0	Since breast tissue is composed of mainly adipose tissue (fat), you will want to follow a plan to reduce your overall body fat levels. When you lose body fat, it will come off from all over your body including your breast tissue. Many women actually see most of the initial fat reduction in the breast region, so its a matter of following the right plan to lose this unwanted body fat.
3177854_3	no we will never stop having terroris problems becaue people are people and every one has a different view and some feel so strongly that they think that fear will make people belive the way that they do and if there is ont one problem there is another like in Japan has little to no terrorisim but thats cause they fear there government or the yacuza wich don't fear here government cause they will usualy do much worse than the government it is not possible in this world to truthfully rid ourselves of terrorisim cause if theres not one theres another and the only way to do it is to remove the centers of fear and agressive behavior in the brain and there is no way to do it to everyone and if you remove those centers were gonna die anyway we need fear to keep us from harm and agressive behavior to fight when theres no other option
735552_0	The most important thing is to concentrate what you are reading, if you don't have enough focus on it you won't recall and even understand it. Most of the time when you have enough concentrate you'll recall the point of your study.. Before reading your kind of study, try to specify what you are exactly going to read. Through this you will have much aim for study your lessons.. Don't forget to make light and the temperate of your room in the best way.

879033_2	There are lots of ways, and I found two pages that can give you some tips -- also, in case its not mentioned, if you cant stay away from frying foods, try frying them in olive oil -- fried chicken is GREAT this way, as well as stir-frys. And olive oil is good for you v/s other oils and fats not being so good.

1440592_8	The true answer to this lies in the instincts that man has inherited from its ancestry.  Man began as a primal beast, a common animal and some of those instincts survive with us to this day.  The desire for violence, greed and tolerance of suffering (which ensured our survival all those hundreds of thousands of years ago) has been brought with us through the ages and remains at the core of our medula oblongata (the basic fight or flight instinct that controls all creatures).  In short, until man learns or evolves to tame his inner beast, absolute lasting peace is a forgone conclusion left only to the dreamers.
2157596_4	Some fish will rest on the bottom of the tank on their belly. My daughter got a gold fish from the school fair and he lived for 6 years. If he is belly up that is not a good sign. Don't over feed him.
3147426_14	White tuna is the white swim muscle of the fish, like white flight muscle on a chicken. Dark muscle is from other parts of the tuna and is more bitter.
198085_4	You can find the answer from the atomic number. The atomic number tells you about the number of protons in an element. If the atom is neutral(i.e non-ionic), the number of protons equal number of electrons. If it is a negative ion, or known as anion, add the charge to the number of protons,to find electrons. If it is a positive ion, or cation, you subtract the charge from the proton to find the number of electrons in the ion. Ion is a charged element or atom.
198085_5	The number of protons is equal to the atomic number of an atom.  To determine the number of electrons, first determine if there is a charge to that atom (making it an ion if it is not zero).  For each + charge, subtract one from the atomic number for the number of electrons.  For each - charge, add one.  Therefore, . . Na has 11 electrons, Na(+) has 10 . . Mg has 12, Mg(2+) has 10 . . F has 9, F(-) has 10. . O has 8, O(2-) has 10. . And no, I am not hooked on 10, just seemed convenient to use the same target.
4462511_0	goldfish will not breed in captivity.. (not without certain standards which a normal tank would not provide).. ergo .. its not pregnant.. . . you can research that one on your own.. but breeding goldfish is near impossible and very costly... . some fish such as mollies, platties, guppies are livebearers and will give birth to live babies.. seperate them immediately .. as the parents will eat them..

4361653_7	In my way of seeing it, people are sad at a funeral because they miss the person who died.  I think some of the most comforting things a person can say/do is just to express your love and care for the people who are feeling grief.. . Phrases like this might help:. "I'm sorry for your loss.". "I love you.". "She was a wonderful person.". . You could even write down some of your happy memories of the deceased and give them in written form to the family.

2928902_0	Hair color comes from melanin (say: meh-luh-nun), the substance that gives hair and skin its pigment. The lighter someone's hair, the less melanin there is. A person with brown or black hair has much more melanin than someone with blond or red hair. Older people lose the melanin pigment in their hair as they age, making their hair look gray or white.
2928902_1	Stress is a big part!  True story...I was married when I was 26 and I started getting gray hair before I turned 27 (I'm now 41 and still don't have a full head of gray hair, just on the sides...my soulmate tells me it looks distinguished).
2928902_2	there are many causes of white/gray hair and one of them is generic and the other is if you are emotional distress or if you started to pull your white/gray hair it would multiply faster.
2928902_4	IN SOME OCCASIONS IT IS BIRTHMARKING,STRESS, OR HEREDITARY MY UNCLE IS 31 AND HAS A WHOLE HEAD OF GRAY HAIR AND IT STARTED @ THE AGE OF 19 SO IN HIS CASE IT'S HEREDITARY B/C MY GRANDMOTHER HAS A HEAD FULL OF GRAY AS WELL AND SHE HAD HERS SINCE 1990

3339774_1	muslim are the people believing in islam religion
3339774_3	islam is the religion..muslim is the followers of Islam
3339774_4	Muslim is the one who obeys the religion Islam.. I offer you to change your mind about muslims. Dont just look at Iran and countries with limitaions for women. In UAE anyone muslim and non-muslim, men and women live together. UAE's people are mostly Cristian after muslims and they are all coping with the situations it is.. Islam is the last religion which has come from god, people believe in god and prophethood.. Muslims believe in all prophets in the history, but we know that the last religion is the most complete and new prophet would be sent by God to people when the last religion is changed or destroyed. Now in Bile there are 101 contradictions and it means that it has to be changed totally.

I've flown on commercial jet aircraft at 10,700 meters.. . However, at altitudes greater than about 21,336 meters the air is getting too thin for conventional jet engines to operate.
3224515_0	To be honest, I think that the majority of racist people in the the U.S. are African Americans. Many of them think that everything you say is directed at them because of their color. It's not true. Many people are still very racist, but most of the world has grown up in a society that looks down on racism and promots equality.
3224515_8	People of any race can be racist, it takes on more power when a white person is racist because of their history of dominating other races.

2814599_1	It doesn't mean five years or more cancer free, though some consider themselves cured after being cancr free for five years or more.  Remission means the symptoms are gone and the cancer is not growing.  As soon as this happens you are in remission baby!

1950329_4	When America first gained independence, Europe said we'd never last cause we spent so much time sueing each other.  In the great American tradition, common sense does not apply to the civil courts.  In other words, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires everything be as accessable as possible, so the drive up ATM's have braile.. . Also, I believe they make ATM's the same way wherever they're ultimately going to put them, so when they make the machine they don't know it's going to be a drive-up one or not.  It would be rather silly to have a whole separate factory for drive up ATM's just so they didn't put braile on the keys.

You can get life insurance policies through several different companies. Most of the time employers offer it with their health insurance policies.

The fraternity next door always made money by selling fried chicken outside of this funeral home.... It was pretty awful.

1028133_3	Goodluck trying, we had a skunk spray while using all methods to remove and it stank for a month. Animal control told us to set a trap away from the house and then slowly put a tarp over the cage and take it to a pond and drown the skunk. Who could do that? Ours finally just left.
3002699_0	Look at modern religious tomes, most of what is in there is just re-worked fables from greek mythology.

3246439_0	Use shortening instead of oil. Make sure your chicken is cold when you fry it. The temp in the chicken contrasted with the hot fat, will keep the oil out of the chicken. Use high enough heat so that you get a good bubble action going. Pan frying can produce crispy chicken. Use bread crumbs with flour.
2731310_9	Pride is a sin, and the bible says God loves those who are humble.  It doesn't mean you cannot be proud of yourself and your accomplishments, you just have to learn how to be humble about it.  I would suggest reading the bible and starting with 1 Peter 5:5-6.  Through prayer and bible study, your wish will be granted!
3614661_0	Becuase Argentina is a country of immigrants, mainly from Italy (where the tarantela is from) and from Spain.. . Unlike most of its neighboring countries, Argentina's population overwhelmingly descends from Europeans. Argentines are a fusion of groups of various national and ethnic origins, the most predominant of these being the descendants of Spanish (settlers from both the colonial era and 19th and early 20th century) and Italian (19th and early 20th century) immigrants.

2864267_0	A willingness to put yourself out a bit for the sake of your customer. In other words, kiss their butt to make a sale.
2864267_1	I used to train people in customer service jobs, the one thing I always wanted them to remember was to treat every customer like they are the most important customer ever. You treat guests in your home with respect and serve them because they are important to you, you should treat guests in your business the same. Remember they are the most important customer you have, even if they don't spend as much as others, or they may be in a bad mood, they are who you have right now, and they are who you are here to serve.
2864267_2	I'm not sure if I understand your question, but I'll give you my opinion anyway, 'cause that's what "Yahoo! Answers" is all about, right??. If you are already a customer service representative, you can gauge your effectiveness by how pleased your customers are with the level of service you have provided to them.  Remember this though: there is no pleasing everyone! If the overwhelming majority are pleased, you're doing great!. As a 24 hour answering service telephone operator, I usually find that the best way to achieve effective cust srvc is by listening, understanding, empathizing, giving realistic solutions to people's problems or concerns and by being as nice to my callers as I would want them to be towards me. . Hope I didn't completely misunderstand your question and I hope it helps!
2864267_3	Effective customer service is not only meeting a customer's needs and concerns but exceeding their expectations.. Be a customer's advocate.

196651_2	A customer is a human being, who customarily purchases a particular product, or service.. A consumer is merely a person, animal, or even machine that consumes any particular product, or service - without necessarily evincing a liking for it, or purchasing it.. For example, if you buy a tub of ice cream you are a customer. If you give it to child, who polishes it off, the child is a consumer. Similarly, a customer will buy a bundle of straw for a cow to consume. And an automobile will consume any brand of petrol purchased by its owner, who is the real customer.... Thus a customer turns into a consumer, only when he/she consumes the purchase. And a consumer turns customer, when he/she chooses a particular product or service, and buys it ! . ...But the sad part is that even persons who are actively involved in marketing and advertising confuse themselves [and others too !] by misusing both of these terms !
339797_0	Not only in India. Almost everywhere A.C voltage is supplied. . Most obvious reason is we generate electricity in the form of A.C. using generators/alternators and distribute to everyone as A.C.. D.C is used for high voltage(low loss) transmissions; Still the end user is supplied A.C. since most of our electric appliances(motors, lights, etc) use A.C.

3833284_1	Passing judgement about someone or something based of prejudices & bias. "All black people eat chicken." That's definitely not true because I have a friend whose African American & does not eat chicken. The thought of eating chicken makes her gag. That stereotype is false because it does not hold true for every African-American person.
1949953_1	Headaches are normally caused by changes in blood pressure. When you alter you’re intake of carbs (carbs and sugars are almost the same) or salts, the result is a change in blood pressure.. . The mechanism is not easy to explain, but it has to do with partial osmotic pressures of glucose and electrolytes in blood and hormones regulating their concentration. It has to do with your kidneys and their ability to drive out or filter those excess solutes in your blood. It also depends on the ability of your tissues (mainly muscles and liver) to store glucose as glycogen.. . So a headache is a multivariable phenomenon, I recommend you should drink healthy amounts of water every day and fruits.

April 20th is a representation of this time, smokers would celebrate their new crops by, what else, gettting stoned.

1374825_0	Back when gas was around 20 or 30 cents a gallon, price wars between competing gas stations were common. Some stations started pricing at say 23.9 cents per gallon, which, to the buyer, is psychologically lower than the 24 cents per gallon being charged across the street. The .1 cent difference does not significantly reduce the revenue to the station owner though. Now that prices are above $2.00, it doesn't really make sense anymore, but it is so firmly established that it's hard to go back.

2188251_4	USA might as well clean up its messes.. . Check history..I attached links.. do the reading. . -US Govt was instrumental in the backing of Saddams rise as a leader.(old cold war politics US backs a candidate USSR backs one)Guess who US backed? 1979  Study how Saddams Predecessor: Abd ar-Rahman Arif left office. . -More cold war Politics When USSR invaded Afgahnistan..US was instrumental in the backing of Ben Ladin...against  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan resulted in a call to arms by religious leaders all over the Muslim world to liberate the country from pro-Soviet rule. Bin Laden eagerly sent money, supplies, and weapons to the jihadis in Afghanistan.. . -More Cold War Politics- Afghanistan... hey USA was instrumental in backing the very same people (Taliban ) that the US just had to go back & chase out of power there a few years ago. . Afghanistan exists at a unique nexus-point where numerous Eurasian civilizations have interacted and often fought and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region today known as Afghanistan has been invaded by a host of peoples, including the Aryans, Medes, Persians, Greeks, Mauryans, Kushans, Sassanians, Arabs, Turks, British, and Soviets, but rarely have these groups managed to exert complete control over the region.. . Even when US was not physically present, the bullets and weapons were present and shell casings which said "Made in USA". . I was shocked when I read it in black & white too.. . I like to think that the US is just doing the right thing too.  I realize that countries administrations act in their country's perceived best interest, which may or may not be perceived as doing the right thing.  During the cold war it was most likely the right thing.  Years later it was like frankenstiens monster.. It had to be cleaned up.  A great evil may have been removed for the greater good of all and for the US.  In 40 years when the new administrations which we just placed in power have become old they may be the monsters.  US may have to go clean up again.. .  If we do not learn from history we are doomed to repeat.

In practice, the term antigen is used to mean any molecule recognized by the immune system. . . Antigens which induce adaptive immunity are called immunogens. All immunogens are antigens, and are usually called antigens unless their ability to induce an immune response is being discussed.

2432081_2	He didn't. Scopes had to pay $100 fine for contravening the Butler Act forbidding the teaching of evolution in public schools in Tennessee although Darrow wanted the case to go to an appeal. On appeal, the law was found to be constitutional but the conviction was overturned on a technicality. The law was not found to be unconstitutional until 1968 with the Butler Act being repealed in 1967.. . What Darrow did achieve was to turn public opinion amongst educated people against the laws, thus setting the scene for a long-term change of opinion. Bryan is generally believed to have come out of it very badly. The Scopes Trial was widely followed and was the subject of books. A play and film "Inherit the Wind" was loosely based on it.
3540587_0	First, ask your aunt if she has any idea of the company or even the person he spoke to about the life insurance policy. Also ask if she knows if he knew any insurance agents on a personal level.

Tell them you are the Beneficiary on the policy and the Policy Owner is your father and now deceased.. Good luck!

3819329_3	First we should define insurance for you.  Insurance is a product AND a service you purchase to protect your assets, things you may own, or have a financial interest in.  A few examples are your auto, life, home, and/or business.  . A liability is an expense you owe someone/something or may owe someone/something else in the future.. When you purchase this very important coverage on any insurance policy you are protecting yourself against a future expense that may occur.. Each asset mentioned above has different types of liability coverages, that protect you from having to pay large or small amounts out of your pocket.. Your insurance agent should be knowledgeable and a person you trust, someone you see as a financial counselor.  The next time your policy renews or if you are purchasing a policy for the first time make sure to discuss if the coverages are ADEQUETE for you and your family.

2452795_3	Think energy. What you want to do is maximize the energy gain, and at the same time minimize the loss. There are several things that you can do. For example:. - Paint the tank black on the outside, so that it will absorb the maximum amount of sunlight. . - Paint the tank silver on the inside, so that it will reflect as much heat as possible as it tries to escape the water.. - Insulate the tank to prevent heat from escaping the water.. - If you have control over the shape, make it as flat as possible, to maximize the surface area, again, to catch as much sunlight as you can.. - If you are willing to spend money on energy, you can heat it with gas, electricity, or both. In this case, heavy insulation on the outside is an absolute must, especially in the middle of winter, or you will lose a lot of cash.... . Hope this helps. Cheers.

3086320_0	It is a kind of "reverse tax" for people that make under $35K and have kids.  It can be for people without kids, but you have to be very poor.  There are many restrictions, and it is not all people, so be careful not to wrongfully claim it, as it is the largest source of tax fraud and the IRS does seek and prosecute violaters.
2709267_2	In the 4th Century, Emperor Constantine had a dream that if he put a cross on his soldiers shields, they would be victorious. After winning a battle (a war?) he made Christianity the official state religion throughout his empire. He decreed that people must desecrate the Sabbath & honor Sunday, "the venerable day of the sun god." No mention of Jesus, God, or anything Christian! He & his mother chose Dec 25 (the winter solstice celebration of the "birth" of the sun god) as the time to celebrate Christmas - and a lot of pagan traditions. One of his church councils (which banned any Jewish bishops of the church) decided  that they would  scrap Passover as a schedule for celebrating Easter & chose to base in on the vernal equinox - for the goddess Ashtar/Ishtar... which is where the word "Easter" originated.. . Pope Sylvester I was a puppet for Constantine; he rubber stamped all of Constantine's heresies (clearly against God's Law & will), claiming that the Pope has the power & authority to change God's Law!. . The believers who followed the Way of the Torah-observant Messiah were shut-out. Constantine & the Pope co-opted the term 'Christianity' for their own use: the Cult of Constantine Church - but is ~sounds more respectable~ as the "Holy Roman Catholic Church."
2709267_6	Most consider it to be the original denomination of Christianity.  In 1054 (correct me if I'm wrong on the year), Christianity split into Catholicism and Orthodoxy.  Catholicism can come in many forms, but by far the most common is Roman Catholicism, which is headed by the Pope.  Protestant religions split from Catholicism again and again and again, with Marten Luther, John Calvin, and even Henry VIII all leading new branches of Christianity.. . I don't know what specifics you are looking for - please elaborate.

Whisky is legal but it dosent grow in your back yard it has to be made if you want it you have to pay tax. if the gov controled all growth of weed then they would be able to tax it. tobacco is nasty but taxable even though it should be as illegal as weed.

There is plenty of time for that, but as someone else said, not a lot of time to be young.  Enjoy your youth and then have children

772531_2	Why do we park on a driveway and Drive on a parkway?? Life is a confusing thing!!
3800929_1	Every object attract and repulse one another. In small bodies such forces have almost no effect because forces are very feeble.Whereas in huge celestial bodies attraction and repulsions are considerable.So earth has been attracting the moon as well as repulsing.Also centrifugal and the centripetal  forces have existed  due to revolution around the earth is  helpful in keeping moon`s orbit.Actually moon is moving towards the earth very slowly.When it comes relatively closer to earth after millions of years moon has to revolve faster to maintain its orbit.Also as it comes nearer to earth it cannot withstand interaction of repulsion attraction of earth hence blasts out into pieces. These pieces will  once again revolve round the earth in different orbits. Small pieces may fall on earth as asteroids.You may wonder  how intelligently the nature is protecting the earth.

714612_0	This goes along with the question of why don't we fall off the earth if it is round. The answer is because gravity is holding us (and the water) down.
714612_1	same reason why people in south (e.g australia) don't fall off earth - earth's gravitational pull.
714612_2	The world isn't round. It's a cube.

714612_7	because there is no gravity strong enough around earth for water to fall of the earth
714612_8	Gravity pushes it down just like it does to everything else on Earth.
714612_9	Because god made it were the earth is like a bowl but the bowl has and dip and the earth dont the earth pokes out but . there is holes in the earth
714612_10	one thing you might want to consider with this one is the center of mass, since that is where the bulk of the pull from gravity will come. Try it out with a basketball/any spherical object. If you put your finger on the surface and were pulled in to the center, look at the direction your finger would have to move: straight down, not off the edge.

Bluetooth provides a way to connect and exchange information between devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, laptops, PCs, printers and digital cameras via a secure, low-cost, globally available short range radio frequency.. . The name Bluetooth was born from the 10th century king of Denmark, King Harold Bluetooth who engaged in diplomacy which led warring parties to negotiate with each other. The inventors of the Bluetooth technology thought this a fitting name for their technology which allowed different devices to talk to each other

4377861_0	To hand sew sequins, you'll need some tiny beads.  You come up through the center of the sequin, through the bead, and then back through the center of the sequin.  The bead must be large enough to hold the sequin on, but not so large to detract from the look of the sequin.
4377861_1	If your design has the sequins separated, the third answer is the best technique.. . However, you can buy sequins in strands, which makes application much faster if you are doing lines.  Not only does your basic hand running stitch work on those, but you can buy a sewing foot called a ribbon foot, which holds the sequins strand in place while you sew it down with your sewing machine.
4377861_2	these days you get a fabric glue with which to paste the sequins onto the fabric. The glue is quite good and the sequins don't come off even after washing. It is available with hobby shops where you buy the sequins.. . If you still want to hand-sew, it'll take a lot of time, you need to put the sequin on the fabric, bring the needle from the edge on the sequin through the fabric, and then again through the center to the other edge.
4377861_3	Hand sew? usually you use a "punch" like a paper punch to push them through the cloth. Try a hobbie store or fabric store or deptment store. I think they are called "stud punchers" or something like that. Unless the sequin had a metal casting like a piece of jewelry does, you'd have to glue them on since there is nothing to run the thread through. I think. good luck

2583102_2	The war was supposedly started because there were weapons of mass destruction stockpiled by Saddam Hussein.  When that turned out to be untrue, the reason for the war somehow morphed into a crusade to establish democracy in Iraq.  Bush continues to try to link Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, even though it is clear that Iraq was never involved.  In short, the war was based on a lie and the lies keep accumulating.  Thousands of people are now dead because George Bush was too arrogant to admit his errors and stop this thing.

2656125_0	The Andromeda Galaxy (also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224; older texts often call it the Andromeda Nebula) is a giant spiral galaxy in the Local Group, together with the Milky Way galaxy. It is at a distance of approximately 2.5 million light years or 770 kpc, in the direction of the constellation Andromeda.. . With a mass of about 1.5 times that of the Milky Way, it is the dominant galaxy of the Local Group, which consists of about 30 small galaxies plus three large spirals: Andromeda, Milky Way and M33. (With improving measurements and data, some scientists now believe that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and may be more massive than M31.)
2656125_2	Answers.com says:. . Andromeda Galaxy, cataloged as M31 and NGC 224, the closest large galaxy to the Milky Way and the only one visible to the naked eye in the Northern Hemisphere. It is also known as the Great Nebula in Andromeda. It is 2.2 million light-years away and is part of the local group of several galaxies that includes the Milky Way, which it resembles in shape and composition. It has a diameter of about 165,000 light-years and contains at least 200 billion stars. Its two brightest companion galaxies are M32 and M110.

2116993_0	We do not really understand what causes the earth's magnetic field, but presumably it is caused by electric currents flowing in the earth, possibly as charged pieces of molten metal move around in the outer core. . . So in this way, the earth's field is due to something more like an electromagnet, which is not destroyed by heat, instead of a permanent magnet, which is destroyed by heat.

921891_4	Because that is in our nature. Since we have brains that act on its own at some level, people (brains) tend to judge everything and that is OK and natural and since people do not know anything about the person they meet or see at the very first moment, they will do the automatic judging with the available information they have and that is sight. Let me give you an example that proves judging does not occur when people look at someone and why it is normal. when you hear some singer on the radio for the very first time and you don't know how he or she looks like, you tend to think (judge) that he or she has a certain type of looks depending on her or his voice until you see that person on TV. It is the same thing; people judge you when they look at you because that is all the info that their brain can get at that instance.

It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. .  Hope that helps you!
3269759_1	Artificial intelligence or AI is computers having the level of human thought.
3269759_2	Intelligence contained in something artificial, like a computer. It could be any machine, a parking meter; something man created. But intelligence in a plant or flower or animal is real intelligence.
3269759_3	It is the intelligence of politicians.
3269759_4	AI is the creation of an adaptive network that is capable of acquiring information and utilizing it, e.i. a learning machine.  What makes humans so unique and dominant are the abilities to learn and create.  Computers can collect a vast amount of information (memory), and programs can use this information (brain).  However programs cannot change, thus they can only repeat their designed tasks, putting them on par with animal instincts.  However recently supercomputers show the ability to change those programs and thus adapting to the environment such as beating grand chess masters or exploring the Mars surface.  So far AI is on a basic level with advanced primates and early toddlers.  When AI reaches the level of self-awareness and making its own decisions, humans will become obsolete.

3416619_3	Are Catholics Christians?  They are only if Jehovah Witnesses and Mormons are, too.  Although I would not call Catholicism a cult like I would the other two, the perversions of the Gospel are just as extreme.  In one sense all three fall under the umbrella of "Christianity," for all of them believe in Christ, to some extent.  However, since the New Testament states that we have no mediator between God except Christ, and Catholics have a priesthood, and pray to saints (the New Testaments states that all Christians are both saints and priests, btw), the Catholic church has more in common with Judaism than with Christianity.
3416619_15	CATHOLICISM IS NOT EXACTLY CHRISTIAN.CATHOLICISM WAS FOUNDED BY CONSTANTINE WHO BROUGHT IN A VERY GECKO BABYLONIAN FORM OF WORSHIPING IDOLS AND DEAD SAINTS.. CHRISTIANS ON THE OTHER HAND WORSHIP ONLY CHRIST IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH.

3457489_0	Resistance training - sometimes called weight training or strength training - is a method of conditioning designed to increase muscle strength, muscle endurance and muscle power. What happens with your muscles when it lifts or pushes something that it is not accustom to is that micro tears happen in the muscle fiber. In 72 hours, these tears get fixed by scar tissue which allows the muscle to increase the amount it can lift / push. That is why your muscles grow and get stronger with weight training, there is more scar tissue there.

The reason race cars are low to the ground is to eliminate drag that slows down the car. Spoilers on the back of a car help to give extra traction. . . If the lift theory you guys were spouting was true then we'd have cars lifting off when the speed gets to fast, and that just doesn't happen. . . You guys probably think the NOS sticker on your honda makes it go faster.

Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Include small amounts of good fats.. 3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. . The most misunderstood weight loss strategy. How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . Releasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don’t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.. . The reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don’t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don’t. But wait there is a solution to that…. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . The world most efficient “fat burner” is FREE and You already have it.. . Before I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. . Weight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic “fat burner” that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so effective, why we need a new one. Ther

3655585_1	No doctor is obligated to see any patient at any time.. . Period.. . The patient can quit, the Doctor can quit, and they don't need a reason.. . If you go to an Emergency room with an EMERGENCY CONDITION, you will be seen, by by the doctor that agrees to see you, but they are only obligated to provide lifesaving treatment.. . You can NOT make a doctor treat you.
3655585_4	Ethically, I don't believe there are any circumstances a doctor can refuse to see a pregnant patient.  . They can refer the patient to another doctor if they don't feel comfortable seeing the patient.. Legally, if a patient cannot pay their bill I still don't think they can refuse to see a patient if the patient has a medical concern about their pregnancy.

And for people like lindsay in her comment above - next time we have a terrorist attack here - you or someone in your family might be in the building when it blows.

I am a smoker and to some degree I understand the smoking in restaurants due to children and expecting mothers but in bars???  come on it is all adults who are there to get their drink on and what is a drink without a cig. BORING! . . SECOND: We The People - are going to lose our freedom, our rights, and our democracy status  the ban on smoking started in a small area and now it is nation wide and beyond ( Castro banned cigar smoking in public areas) go figure!  The ignorant are all proud of the ban success which is leading to what is now-pro-life vs pro-choice-. In South Dakota the Governor banned abortions and any doctor caught performing one will automatically serve 5 years in prison. now wait-the law there stipulates that a woman can ONLY have an abortion if it is life threatening to her.  If she becomes pregnant by rape or incest then she must carry the baby to term!!!!!!. WE woman are still considered second class citizens what the hell will we become if we are stripped of our rights!!!!!  TO CHOOSE.

4185501_0	he Sun shines because it sends out energy in all directions as radiation. This radiation takes the form of light and heat
4185501_1	Lots of wax and elbow grease.

4185501_4	to bring light into our lives
4185501_5	It doesn't shine, it burns.
4185501_6	The sun shines because of nuclear fusion in its core. Hydrogen is combined into Helium and there is also some C-N-O cycle fusion too. Light from the core takes many thousands of years to leave through the surface of the sun. If the sun were to stop shining, it would take a long time before we knew. If the sun did stop fusing in the core, it would collapse.

4185501_8	Any object warmer than zero kelvins radiates energy.  The sun has a core temperature in the millions of kelvins and a effective surface temperature of about 6000 kelvins.  An object that warm emits radiation with a peak wavelength of about 500 nanometers, which is visible, which is what we see as "shining."
4185501_9	Okay everyone sing along:. . The sun is a mass of incandescent gas. A gigantic nuclear furnace. Where Hydrogen is built into helium. At a temperature of millions of degrees
4185501_10	the people that says the sun burns is wrong, the fact that it seems like a giant ball of fire doesn't make it burning or in fire. It is actually a ball of condensed energy mainly in the form of light and heat. These huge energy is produced by the nuclear fusion on its core. The sun shines because the light energy released by the sun

3395908_2	Nails are made of metallic iron which is silvery if you ignore the oxide coating.. Iron tablets contain ionic iron which looks very different and depends on what the iron is ionically bonded to. For example Iron Sulphate is ionic iron bonded to a sulphate ion and is a blue liquid or crystal. The ionic compound in your tablets are some other from of iron based ionic compound and I don't know exactly what that is. . . So metallic iron and ionic iron look and feel very different even though they are basically the same atom.

1428555_1	Libraries are a source of many other activities than just borrowing books. How about the mentoring programs, the English conversation groups, Book discussion clubs? We all know that discussing a book online is not as interactive as doing it face to face, the same applies to the other activities also. . We could just stroll through the library... through sections that we never planned on visiting, and discover something new that interests us everytime. Now think about sitting on your computer and deciding to peruse through all the books in any given collection. One would give it up after the first ten books out of sheer boredom.. I will list more problems if they come to mind. Hope these help.

I would speak to your public librarian especially if you are in Canada.
445880_0	Well, at pharmacies they have wart removers, but I haven't had much luck with them.  The wart is caused by a virus so eventually it will go away.  But if you can't stand them anymore, taking garlic pills works well (garlic boosts immunity among other things).  I've also heard that leaving duct tape on a wart for awhile gets rid of them, but as warts do best in warm sweaty areas I don't know how helpful that would be...

3084462_4	Its important to remember that the customer defines good customer service. If you go to McDonalds and they get your order right and its fast then they have done a good job delivering customer service. If all you got was fast service and the right food at Ruth Chris' steak house you would be disappointed. The expectations for good customer service are different at Ruth Chris' steak house than they are at McDonalds. . . Find out what the customer expects and that is your definition of good customer service. Incidentally, it makes no sence to deliver on something the customer has no interest in. At McDonalds for example, they experiemented with waiters who actually came to your table and took your order. It didn't work well because when most people go to McDonalds they just want the right food fast.. . GE

4250296_4	DNR is too much humbug about nothing. . Leave it to the doctors to decide whether your illness and physical state is worth resuscitating or not..  . Trust them ,they do have a conscience of their own.. . Learn to just trust , as you trust an unknown group of people in your bank with your money.
4250296_5	They provide comfort measures, such as pain control and nutrition, and other nursing care that any patients would get, but the difference is that they don't do life saving measures such as CPR or defibrillation or other "code" measures.  They are allowed to die peacefully.  As far as where they put them - they can either be in a hospital as a DNR patient, or if a doctor certifies that they have less than 6 months to live, they may be admitted to hospice, which could involve home care, so they may be seen by a home health nurse and given pain meds, etc. at home.
4250296_6	All healthcare professionals involved in the care of that patient will not do anything to prolong the patient's life if in case patient deteriorates/dies. DNR orders may be modified, some may choose mechanical ventilation, or drugs. Usually when a pt is DNR, comfort measures is provided only.
4250296_7	If a patient is a DNR they will provide comfort measures such as pain medication CPAP and the such.  The only things they are not allowed to do in chest compressions, intubation, and resus. meds.
3041873_8	It's of course the white European egotism, thinking they are superior to all others and can enslave blacks, slaughter reds, and p*ss on yellows at will.. . Birds think that North is up.

Every species that migrates across the equator breeds in the northern hemisphere.

Unfortunately, many politicians continue to *act* like we have a large military.. . They claim that by trimming the force down some, we can accomplish "more with less." However, there comes a time when less doesn't get you more of anything other than exhausted troops.
823384_1	democrats and clinton are the ones to be thanked for that
823384_2	It wasn't just personel cuts in the Clinton years.  Yes, the cuts started earlier, but the funding cuts and the vastly increased deployments were the "wag the dog" of the Clinton Admin.. . I actually kept bags packed in Germany calling the "scandel bags" as every time Clinton had a scandel (Whitewater, China Gate I and II, File Gate, Travel Gate, Monica, strange "suicides", etc), we would be deployed.  Add to this the unlawfull use of the Army at Waco, TX, the debacle in Somolia, Deployments to Haiti, IFOR/SFOR (you know, the "1 year missions"), cruise missles into Afghanistan, Missles and bombers daily in Iraq, etc and so on.. . We also had very little money for training, housing, and maintenance.  Fuel was in short supply.  Our tanks could run less than 100 optempo miles/year due to parts, fuel, and other commitments.  Qualifying Tanks had to share ammunition and many qualifications were done in old simulators.  Even rifle and pistol ammo was in short supply.. . This was the state of affairs in 2000 during the elections... and to add insult to injury, the national socialist left did everything possible to throw out the military absentee ballots, and then did it again in 2004.
823384_3	What are you talking about?  It was all Clinton's falt.  He was the only one in Office back there who else is there to blame?
823384_4	Actually, personnel cuts began in the early 1990's righr after the Gulf War, under Bush Sr. . . Apparently, the official policy was that a strong army was no longer needed, us being the only remaining superpower. Their shortsighted minds never figured WHY we were the only remaining superpower (because of our superior military), and proceeded to dismantle our armed forces. Both Bush Sr. and Clinton share responsibility for this folly. . . Boy, were they wrong!

Many b*tches will have false pregnancies and some will go thru ALL the motions up to and including nesting, labor and producing milk. I'd spring for the test or ultrasound or simply wait until you can see or feel them moving by about day 40-45. X-rays to determine number can be done AFTER the pups have calcified skeletons, usually around day 45 onwards.

1686985_2	Emotional Intelligence, also called EI or EQ, describes an ability, capacity, or skill to perceive, assess, and manage the emotions of one's self, of others, and of groups. However, being a relatively new area, the definition of emotional intelligence is still in a state of flux. Some, such as John D. Mayer (2005a) prefer to distinguish emotional knowledge from emotional intelligence, as discussed below.. . In 1920, E. L. Thorndike, at Columbia University, (Thorndike 1920), used the term "social intelligence" to describe the skill of getting along with other people. In 1975, Howard Gardner's The Shattered Mind, (Gardner 1975) began the formulation of the idea for "Multiple Intelligences" (he identifies eight intelligences), including both interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence. Many psychologists, such as Gardner, believe that traditional measures of intelligence, such as the IQ test, fail to fully explain cognitive ability. (Smith 2002). . The term "emotional intelligence" appears to have originated with Wayne Payne (1985), but was popularized by Daniel Goleman (1995). The leading research on the concept originated with Peter Salovey and John "Jack" Mayer starting in the late 1980s. In 1990, their seminal paper (1990) defined the concept as an intelligence. Mayer and Salovey continued to research the concept, and created an emotional intelligence test called the MSCEIT (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test). The term "emotional quotient" seems to have originated in an article by Keith Beasley (1987). Bar-on (1997) developed a test measuring emotional quotient, called the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi). There are numerous other assessments of emotional intelligence each advocating different models and measures.. . I copied it from the site.

1701129_2	There are no exercises which reduce specific areas of the body. However, crunches and abdominal exercises will increase the muscles and once the fat has reduced around the abdominal area the muscles will show through teh skin.. The only way to reduce fat is through cardio-vascular exercise and diet.. 1lb = 3500 calories. Reducing your calories by 500 a day will lose 1 lb in a week.. I recommend the free www.sparkpeople.com where you can develop a healthy eating and exercise plan to accomodate your needs. They also have great demos for ab exercises! =). Good luck to you
2454927_0	whats up man i have a 2000 civic si and the best way to make it not sound like a pissed off bumble bee on speed is to change out the muffler with an aftermarket muffler which you can get and have put on for a couple hundred dollars or you can go with a complete cat back exhaust which will last alot longer and sound much better but that route cost alot more money so it really depends on your own preference. if your going for performance and sound i would go with the full exhaust thats what i did and it made a big difference. i hope i was some help good luck and dont listen to all that trade it in or buy a ford mess.  in my opinion you have a better car and to me imports are the only way to go.

4044733_1	I personally like my space. If you do too, then sure, give alone a try. You can always have friends over when you're lonely, but you can't kick a roommate out just for the night when you want alone time.
4044733_7	That depends on your personality.  If you are someone who likes their alone time and enjoys having their own space then I would reccomend that.  If you like a little bit of a social atmosphere at home then get a roommmate.  You can still have the personal space of your room but also have someone there to talk to everyonce in awhile.  There are advantages either way, but it is really what you would feel most comfortable with.

There are two species, the Chinese Water Dragon, Physignathus cocincinus, and the Australian Water Dragon, Physignathus lesueurii. They are sometimes kept as pets, especially P. cocincinus, though a full-grown male of that species will measure about three feet (1 meter) total length and thus requires a fairly large enclosure for proper care.

3103275_2	A reverse mortgage  works by taking out the equity that one has build up over the years in their home ownership. For example, say you dad passed away ( this is fiction not to be taken seriously)and your mom was stuck with high medical bills and can't afford it. However their house was almost paid  off. what she could do was to get the reverse mortgage, which means she is borrowing against the equity in the house. And she could get a payment each month to pay off the bills.
1793190_1	Regular lemonade is just lemon juice, sugar, and water.  Pink lemonade has a different juice added like cranberry or strawberry.
1793190_3	Pink lemonade just has color added to it, either from red fruit juice or food coloring.  There is a "legend" that the first pick lemonade was made at a circus when the lemonade seller ran out to water and grabbed up a bucket of water that had a performer's red tights soaking in it!

862822_3	When younger, I loved the tropical weather of my homeland. There were so many days of the year that were "perfect." (The TV weather guy was a sort of joke - he repeated himself, day after day.). . Weirdly enough, in my "later" years I fell in love with the weather of southern England - especially Devon & Cornwall. The moisture made my old skin feel better and it never got too hot or cold - an it was always green, which I didn't expect at those latitudes! As they say here, go figure.
862822_8	My answer takes into account weather and time of day :).  I love twilight, on a clear night, the day before another nice, clear day.  The skin gets pink, the sunsets are beautiful...I particularly like that in autumn, when the air is crisp and cold, but not freezing.  For about an hour, as long as it lasts, that is my favorite weather :)

2308189_0	You could say the nucleus is everything to a cell.. . -It controls cell division-a cell without a nucleus cannot reproduce because the nucleus contains chromosomes which hold all the 'information' about a cell.. -It basically controls all the metabolic activities of the cell, like the type of enzymes to be produced, protein synthesis etc.. -In doing this, the nucleus determines what a particular cell will be like e.g. a guard cell; root hair cell. Without a nucleus, I guess all plant cells would be identical because they wouldn't know what each of their function is.

534968_3	A money market account is through an investment firm. The investment firm invests your money in various ways. Most commonly the stock market. Stocks, bonds, foreign exchange (currency between coutries), real estate, treasury bills, etc.. They are constantly buying & selling, buying & selling & re-investing. The money you make on their investments, is taxable, just like earning interest in a savings account.. A 401K plan is the same thing - an invetment firm of your employers choosing, invests your money. The difference between the two, is a 401K plan is tax deferred.

Try talking to the teacher.  Tell them that you are good and you don't understand why you get punished with the bad kids.  . . If you aren't willing to do that, then there's a good chance you aren't as good as you claim to be.

3910925_0	Haha, I answered this same question less than 10 minutes ago.... . That's something I've often wondered, myself. We yawn because our brain isn't getting enough oxygen. Maybe there's something subliminal going on. Maybe seeing someone yawn somehow makes your brain want more oxygen.
3910925_1	for the same reason that women who live together begin their period within  a day or two of each other.
3910925_2	It's contagious to only those with an empathetic mind. Not everyone has one, so not everyone is going to yawn if someone else does.. . Don't listen to that Brisbane Roo character--he's full of it. It's true what he said about periods, but that has nothing to do with yawning.

3910925_6	I can't answer the question, but you are right, it is contagious! I actually found myself yawning while reading the question and as I typed the word just now! Hope somebody has a good answer for this because I'd like to know, too!
3910925_7	Well, I don't know why yawns are contagious because scientists really don't know what cause yawn's in the first place. However, on a lesser level, I believe yawns are contagious because when you see someone yawn, you tend to think of how tired you are. Therefore, you yawn too. And plus it is pretty amusing when you have a yawn fest with someone and just cannot stop yawning back and forth.. Hope this helps!
3910925_8	The reason why we yawn is unexplained.  Believe it or not, it's not done because we are tired or because there is a lack of oxygen in our lungs.  Some socialogists believe that the act of yawning dates back to cave men.  It may have been communication tool, not unlike sign language, that signaled it was time to head back into the caves and rest.  It's sonething that has been passed on from generation to generation and for some reason never faded once other forms of language were developed.
3910925_9	Yawning is contagious because of the “mirror-neuron system,” -- it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing.

And plus it is pretty amusing when you have a yawn fest with someone and just cannot stop yawning back and forth.. Hope this helps!
1961993_3	Yawning happens when you need more air. Yawning is contagious because technically, you're stealing other people's air, and then they need the air, and then they yawn, and more air is stolen, and then more people yawn...

3143517_14	Its not contagious...when you see someone yawn is an automatic reaction to yawn yourself...its primarily a mental issue...its inbred from when u were younger adn they told u not to yawn because everyone would start yawning causing a chain reaction...u can avoid it if u seriously think about it...

1948910_22	Do holding your breath, getting scared or breathing into a paper bag cure the hiccups. For some people, these methods do work. But, if you already tried these and still have the hiccups give one of the following suggested cures a try:. . 1. A spoonful of sugar swollowed dry.. . 2. Suck in and swallow your own breath. (If you know how to make yourself burp on command, it's the same kind of motion).. . 3. Tickle the roof of your mouth with a Q-tip.. . 4. Suck on a lemon wedge.. . Do any of these work? Who knows. The sucking air one has worked for me before a few times, other people swear that sugar is the percent cure for hiccups.. . Notes:. If you have hiccups for more than a few days, you should go see a doctor as it could be a medical problem.

3549513_1	If trade deficit occurs, that translates to owing other countries $$ which translates to needing to effectively transfer or holding more gold reserves toward those country's interest.  THAT TRANSLATES TO A WEAKENED "DOLLAR" and hence AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL MONETARY & FEDERAL BANKS INTEREST RATES TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE COUNTRYS ECONOMY.. . 1) HIGHER FEDERAL BANK RATE(RESERVES) > HIGHER COMMERCIAL BANK RESERVES > LESS CASH FOR COMMERCIAL BANKING BUSINESS REINVESTMENTS. . 2) HIGHER BANK RESERVES > COMMERCIAL BANK SPREAD NEED TO BE READJUSTED FOR PROFITABILITY > BORROWING RATES WILL BE HIGHER FOR CONSUMER AND BUSINESS > CONSUMER AND BUSINESS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE GOODS AND/OR SERVICES AS MUCH BECAUSE THE COST OF BORROWING HAVE INCREASED THEREBY AFFECTING THEIR LIVELIHOOD TO THE DETRIMENT.. . 3) INTERNATIONAL MONETARY RATES INCREASE - WILL NOW COST THE COUNTRY MORE TO RETAIN THE BULLION IN THE COUNTRY BY HAVING TO PAY MORE FOR THE 'DOLLAR'

Although its motion is not readily apparent, the entire galaxy is rotating about the Milky Way's center. Relative to the universe, the galaxy is moving at a speed of c.370 mi per sec (c.590 km per sec) in the same direction that the constellation Leo lies relative to the earth; it is also moving at c.60 mi per sec (c.100 km per sec) relative to the center of mass of the local group of galaxies. The sun, traveling at a speed of c.150 mi per sec (c.240 km per sec) in a nearly circular orbit, takes 200–230 million years to complete one revolution.. Visual Characteristics of the Milky Way. . Among the constellations the Milky Way passes through are Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Sagittarius (where it is brightest), Scorpius, Aquila, Cygnus, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, and Gemini. In the direction of Cygnus is the Great Rift, a band of dark matter that lies along the Milky Way, dividing it into two forks. Another dark region is the Coalsack, in Crux. Once believed to be vast empty regions in space, these dark areas are now known to be clouds of dark matter blotting out the light behind them. Such nonluminous clouds of dust and gas, called dark nebulae, obscure many parts of the sky from sight; in the direction of the galactic center, the view is almost entirely obscured.. . Size and Shape of the Milky Way. . The Milky Way is a large galaxy comprising an estimated 200 billion stars (some estimates range as high as 400 billion) arrayed in the form of a disk, with a central elliptical bulge (some 12,000 light-years in diameter) of closely packed stars lying in the direction of Sagittarius. It is surrounded by a flat disk marked by six spiral arms—four major and two minor—which wind out from the nucleus like a giant pinwheel. Because of these arms, the Milky Way was classified as a spiral galaxy. However, increasing evidence indicates that the Milky Way probably has a bar or barlike structure of new, bright stars in its central region. This would modify its classification to a barred spiral or an intermediate type between barred and “normal” spiral. Our sun is situated in one of the smaller arms, called the Local or Orion Arm, that connect the more substantial next inner arm and the next outer arm. The sun lies roughly two thirds of the way from the center of the disk, which is some 28,000 light-years distant, and in the galactic plane. When we look in the plane of the disk we see the combined light of its stars as the Milky Way. The diameter of the disk is c.100,000 light-years; its average thickness is 10,000 light-years, increasing to 30,000 light-years at the nucleus.. . Certain features of the region near the sun suggested that our galaxy resembles the Andromeda Galaxy. In 1951 a group led by William Morgan detected evidence of spiral arms in Orion and Perseus. Another bright arm stretches from Sagittarius to Carina in the southern sky. With the development of radio astronomy, scientists have extended a nearly complete map of the spiral structure of the galaxy by tracing regions of hydrogen that dominate the spiral arms.. . Surrounding the galaxy is a large spherical halo of globular star clusters that extends to a diameter of about 130,000 light-years; this is called the stellar halo. The galaxy also has a vast outer spherical region called the corona, or dark halo, which is as much as 600,000 light years in diameter and, in addition to dark matter which accounts for most of the Milky Way's mass, includes some distant globular clusters, the two nearby galaxies called the Magellanic clouds, and four smaller galaxies.. . Stellar Populations and Galactic Evolution. . The stars, gas, and dust that make up the Milky Way can be grouped into two broad stellar populations that suggest

254406_0	If you don't file your taxes you pay a fine of $25,000.00 for every year or One Year of Jail. (This asumes you only forgot to pay them). . If you did not file your taxes because you did not wanted to pay them (Evasion) the fine is up to $100,000.00 or Five Years of Jail.. . It is wise to file a return even in cases where a taxpayer may not have enough resources to pay the entire tax bill. . . The IRS will work out a payment plan with taxpayers in these cases. . . The IRS usually does not pursue criminal charges against taxpayers who file of their own volition before the IRS has contacted them. The IRS also tends to be more sympathetic in collecting taxes from taxpayers who volunteer their late returns than taxpayers the IRS had to investigate and "catch."
254406_1	Don't know the maximum and in any event it will vary from country to country (so in some parts of the world it's probably life).  The minimum could be whatever the Judge decides.  A friend of mine was sentenced for not paying his car tax - his sentence was to wait in the courtroom until the Magistrates reconvened after lunch - about an hour (not technically a jail sentence tho).

3491953_4	how are lemonade and pink lemonade any different? I know the color, but what's the point???
3491953_5	A pink lemonade variation can be produced by adding red food coloring or grenadine syrup. Traditionally, beet juice provided the pink color; so little is needed that the flavor of the drink remains largely unchanged. This beverage may have originated as a replacement for "Indian lemonade," a cold infusion of red sumac berries, sometimes sweetened with maple sugar. Sumac beverages have a taste and appearance similar to pink lemonade, and were popular with Native Americans and early European settlers.

696384_0	Well, I don't know why yawns are contagious because scientists really don't know what cause yawn's in the first place. However, on a lesser level, I believe yawns are contagious because when you see someone yawn, you tend to think of how tired you are. Therefore, you yawn too. And plus it is pretty amusing when you have a yawn fest with someone and just cannot stop yawning back and forth.. Hope this helps!

3960080_0	Airplanes flying from Europe or Asia to different parts of North America do fly polar flight paths. Simply put, the  most direct route between any two points on the surface of a sphere (which the earth ALMOST is) is called the great circle path. To my knowledge, there are no 2 commercial airfields on the earth whose great circle path would take them over the pole directly.
3960080_1	That's Santa's territory.
3960080_2	of course not.because the storm is very strong. that's why the we don't use commercial planes fly over North Pole because the plane will not get the balance because of the strong storm
3960080_3	If a plane went down up there, how the heck would survivors be rescued?
3960080_4	They don't fly over the MAGNETIC North pole because it messes up their instruments.  The don't fly over the GEOGRAPHIC North pole because there is nothing to navigate by.
3960080_5	There is nothing aerodinamical that will prevent airplanes from flying directly over the pole, yet airlines in routes such as New York-Hong Kong take a small detour when going over the pole.  The reason is not to mess with avionics and guidance systems (at the pole all directions are South and computers may react in unintended ways). The concerns are similar to those about the year 2K issues back in the year 2000.

4365565_0	Could be a leak. The water flowing in to the hot water heater. Maybe the valve for the hot water heater is not opened enough.
4365565_1	At your home, a water utility supply line into your home is typically only 1 inch in diameter.  This 1 inch pipe is split multiple time to route water to every watter connection in your home i.e toilet, shower, sink, outside faucet.  Each of these connections is typically only 1/2 inch...so the more open lines a home has the lower the pressure will be, as the incoming pressure from the water company is held fairly constant.
4365565_2	In your house? Most cities have water towers. As the tower gets fuller the pressure goes up. As you use the water it gradually goes down. Most cities have automated systems when the tower or pressure gets so low pumps are activated to refill the tower. This is the basics. Alot more involved in the treatment and other processes.
4365565_3	Well it depents on the source of water supply, if it provides higher pressure then more water will pour out the hose. Water consumers also affects it, if there are consumption occuring from the same supply then the pressure gets lower.. . Altitude doensn't affect that much.

836743_0	Well, the youngest astronauts would be in their late 20's, and they should be sexually mature enough to be the masters of their domains for the duration of their flights. Most astronauts shouldn't be in space for more than a few weeks at a time, anyway.

If you research the language of origin, you'll usually be able to figure out the reason for unusual pronunciations.  Check the dictionary. It usually tells the origin of a word.  The word you used as an example has its origin in French.  That explains the pronunciation.
3437607_0	Since like 99.9% of Italy is Roman Catholic they go to mass(church) Easter Morning. Plus they start on Palm Sunday which is actually a week before easter, or wait, I think it started Ash Wednesday they're supposed to fast for 40 days before Easter, but most just give up something they like to eat alot, like say veal or pasta or wine etc. Anyways on Easter Sunday there is a big meal served with red wine, and most gather with family and the women all wear black, as a sign of mourning for the death of Jesus. Not really a celebration though.
641466_0	The most important thing for your customer to know about life insurance is how much coverage they actually need.  Review their entire financial situation.

Another approach is to Educate the Prospective Client to the Cost and Expense of a family when it lose a Spouse, especially the one making the living, Add up their Debt and show to them on paper how the Stress of Bills will keep coming in. Explain how life insurance can eliminate the total debt of the Family and provide for the Education of the Children and an income for the surviving spouse. It takes Math and on paper so people can see and understand. Explain things like Trust Funds and how they can provide far into the Future. Be more than just a life insurance salesperson. Explain the many options of what the Family CAN do with this money so it not be depleted in a short amount of time. The better you can show more than just an insurance policy the more policies you will sale.

1351142_6	Density and displacement. If the coin were hammered into a thin bowl then, although the metal is more dense than water it would be spread across a wider area and it would displace less than its own weight in water, so it would float. That's why metal ships float. The wood is naturally less dense than water so it floats on water.
1351142_8	The density of an object tells us weather it will float in water or not. If the density is greater than that of water, then it will float. another way is to calculate the relative density of a substance(relative density=density of substance/density of water). If the relative density>1, then the substance will sink.

3282791_24	Consider it your stereotype. Like all black people love fried chicken, all mexicans overstuff themselves into tiny cars, and now....all white people are racist. Stereotypes come about when people start to generalize an entire group of people based on the actions of a few. Nobody likes them but they will always be around. Then on the other hand a lot of white people tend to say things that may be construed as racist even if they didn't intend it to be that way. That's life.
834635_0	Well, I don't know why yawns are contagious because scientists really don't know what cause yawn's in the first place. However, on a lesser level, I believe yawns are contagious because when you see someone yawn, you tend to think of how tired you are. Therefore, you yawn too. And plus it is pretty amusing when you have a yawn fest with someone and just cannot stop yawning back and forth.. Hope this helps!

2589023_3	I like the 'Trouts' response.. . So your friends can see you smile. . . As for the reason it 'shines', this is indeed due to the combustion therein emitting radiation in the form of visible light. The sun, due to its immense heat, emits yellow/white light. As we are all aware a rainbow delights us with seven core colours. Sun-light consists of all these 'colours' which we perceive as white. Although not visible to the naked eye, the sun emits light radiation (or waves) in infra-red and x-ray as well. . . The first link below will give you details that is not appropriate for this forum. It mentions Angstroms, which in this context, is unsuitable. Check out the view of the sun in X-ray and Infra-red, fantastic. Other awesome pictures of the sun (and other heavenly things) are available through the Hubble web-site.. . The second link is a detailed decription of the sun. It goes into a full description of the wave-forms emitted (including micro and radio etc). An enjoyable read, check it out. It goes into all manner of crazy details.. . Cheers, L
2589023_5	because the nuclear fusion reactions that take place inside the sun produce electromagnetic radiation and some of this is in the visible region of that spectrum so to us it appears to shine.

My best advice is to get your pit-bull on a normal schedule of eating, going outside, and playing and the whining will decrease and eventually cease.

UV on the other hand will absorb quite strongly so the emission will be very strong.

2847807_5	This always works for me. . Get a glass of water....take a breath then hold your breath...while holding your breath take for small sips of water...don't take a breath between sips...after the fourth sip of water continue to hold your breath while you count to four (four seconds) then exhale...inhale and repeat....after doing this two to three times your hiccups will likely be gone....if not then do it again but for a few more cycles.
2847807_6	Try to relax and drink some fresh fruit juices to soothe your throat or eat something nice that will make u forget your hiccups. Stop breathing for a while may help.
2847807_7	Hiccups occur when your diaphragm (air controller) sorta malfunctions...I hold my breath for as long as I can. This prevents you from having to worry about hiccuping for a bit while the diaphragm returns to normal

439645_31	rg brooks19 has a great answer. This war was started by Bush because he lost face big time after 9/11. He failed to find bin Laden, he failed to avenge all those who died, and he failed to live up to his promises he made standing at ground zero. Bush made the mistake of thinking this would be a quick and painless war, one that would look good on the evening news, and increase his popularity rating. I personally believe Bush should be impeached for starting this war. He lied to Congress, and he lied to us.

456214_0	Absolute zero is important because it is very likely to be the lowest temperate possible, and is most likely unobtainable.

Personally I wouldn't want to try anything like quantum thermodynamics using celcius or fahrenheit because the temperatures below zero would most likely turn out to be a lot tougher to deal with.
456214_1	kelvin is an absolute scale, which means it has meaning. Celsius says water freezes at zero degrees, while every one knows it freezes at 32 degrees. or maybe not? there is also degrees reamur. absolute zero, in degrees kelvin, is non-attainable, because a number of physical variants are infinite at that temperature.
456214_2	absolute zero is not important in everyday life but if i were a scientst trying to develop an extremly powerful computer chip and it ran most efficiently at absolute zero i would be most interested in obtaining that information.

728428_1	Dr. Provine suggests that perhaps yawning is like stretching. Yawning and stretching increase blood pressure and heart rate and also flex muscles and joints. Evidence that yawning and stretching may be related comes from the observation that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is somewhat "unsatisfying." For some reason, the stretching of jaw and face muscles is necessary for a good yawn.. It is possible that yawns are contagious because at one time in evolutionary history, the yawn served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. When one member of the group yawned to signal an event, all the other members of the group also yawned. Yawns may still be contagious these days because of a leftover response (a "vestigial" response) that is not used anymore. None of this has been proven true and yawns are still one of the mysteries of the mind.

970045_2	It's not the childrens fault. The parents want to be their best friend instead parenting. Kids are allowed to whine and complain, watch tv, play videos, over eat. These promote an unhealthy lifestyle, laziness, and lack of use of imagination.
1340574_0	christmas and easter are the two most revered season in the catholic liturgical year.while the church requires that weekly church attendance is best, perhaps some people think birth and death are reasons worthy of celebrating and better that celebration than nothing at all. it's like an exercise plan for the new year that peters out after a month. of course that is when they can show off their new clothes.oh no'
1340574_1	They some how feel that it sufficient to only worship God on the 2 biggest occasions of worship.  Sadly, they are only fooling themselves.
1340574_2	It's better than not going to church at all I guess.  People consider Sunday part of their weekend -- their time to do whatever they want basically -- rather than as the day God set aside to be the Sabbath.  But they nonetheless want to be good people so they go on Easter and Christmas, because those are the days they think it's most important for them to go.  They simply don't think its important for them to go every sunday.
1340574_3	I think it is because they want to seem like they actually care some about christ. But they don't believe enough to go to church every sunday (and wednesday.). But they know churches usually have something special going on for christmas and easter and they would like to see it, but church isn't that important to go every sunday/wednesday or they just say they're too busy and they'll get around to it when they can.
1340574_4	They're covering their bases, so if Christianity is true,when they pass they can say "Look God, I went to church on the most Holy of days".
1340574_5	I don't think they're real religious. I think they just want to enjoy the holidays in their own way. Going to church just adds to the event.
1340574_6	I believe that we go to church to satisfy ourselves and not God. I think that God cares more about what we do with our lives then if we sit in church for 1-3 hours on a Sunday morning. I think that some people go to church to be seen by others. I go to church almost every Sunday because I want to.
1340574_7	haha my mom makes us go to church on easter and xmas...because they call themselvs christians and in most masses they r like o well ummm i was uhh to busy..but on easter and xmas theres no excuse so they feel like bad christians. personally i think churhc is pretty damn boring i dont ever like to go..talking to god is great. singing and lsitneing to people talk about god is not great..
1340574_8	because they're hipacrites.  you don't need church to believe in a higher power.  do they think that the preacher is like "glad to see you"  no he's thinking wtf have u been
1340574_9	because some people think that's the "right" thing to do. because those 2 holidays are celebrating the birth and death of Christ, they think it makes sense to go on those 2 days. that's what i think.
1340574_10	some people only go for the free stuff but those are sefish people
1340574_11	Either Fear, want to repent sin, or just plain lazy...
1340574_12	They are smart.
1340574_13	Some people have grown up with the tradition of going to church on the "major" holidays and so they continue to either out of an "obligation" or just something they have done in the past. For Roman Catholics Easter isthe beginning of a new year. All things are made new. A new hope a new chance some do take the opportunity to come back into the church during Easter and Christmas while most fit your observation.
1340574_14	I guess they think God is like a distant relative who will be happy that we check in once in a while.. . God wants to be in our lives each second of the day.  Not just on certain holidays.
1340574_15	PSEUDO CHRISTIANS
1340574_16	laziness and busy-ness. I admit i am one of the people you just described but i am a christian. I know it's so bad to not make time to go to church but i'm just too tired and busy on sundays.
1340574_17	they have no sense!
1340574_18	They are Christians in name only.
1340574_19	Some people feel quite a bit of guilt because they are not living the life they should by putting HIM first, or not being as spiritual as they should.  They try to fill that void by going to church on the "so-called" important days.. . Some folks just want to show off their new outfit.
1340574_20	Because they are bigots.  These are the people that think church is something they only have to do on Sundays and holidays.  These are the people that we should feel sorry for.  I am not much for organized religion but I am not against it.  What I am against are these people that go once or twice every 3 or 4 months and think this is their key to heaven.  Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think so, ignorance is bliss.
2600828_5	Some non Christian, Group of Non Christians or Current US President created a great plot to commercialize Christian holidays and bring Christianity to is demise. Just think rabbits and eggs on Easter for Jesus rising from the dead, Santa Clause on Christmas for the birth of Jesus, and what about St. Patrick's day? They took a good Christian Saint and turned him into a reason to drink Beer and eat corn-beef cabbage. I rest my case.. . I say it was Terrorist and/or George W. Bush one or the other gets blamed for everything now days anyway so what is one more thing. If you talk to some people they are one in the same. . . Although all the things we blame GW for could be a terrorist plot designed by Osama Bin Laden.
1991463_9	Many here in Europe think this as EUROPEANS KNOW ABOUT THE IRAQ WAR. Americans obviously don't and that is why some call them evil- when in fact Americans just don't know.. The government runs the media (They have had their biggest ever profits in all the wars the us has ever had)
3684466_6	Eat lots of protein and work out a lot. Do weight stuff in particular. But be sure to only lift weights three times a week or you'll be hurting.
402514_0	i think the key might be in the slow cooking...... as far as the skin is concerned, i like to rub the potato in olive oil and cover with seasonings (anything you like, or just seasoned salt is okay) and then poke all over with a fork or icepick and wrap in tin foil.  i cook on 350 for a long time....checking every once in a while....but it does take 45-60 minutes.
402514_1	A lot of restaurants season the outside of the potatoes before they bake them.  This can make quite a difference in the taste.  Also, make sure you are using full fat sour cream, not low fat.  Oddly, I think most restaurants actually use margarine on their potatos instead of butter, which to me tastes more salty than butter.  Try adding a little salt to your potato, too.
402514_2	Due to the cooking time a lot of restaurants bake potatos twice. Wrap them in foil, with some course sea salt for the first bake. Allow them to cool, unwrap them and bake again.
402514_3	I would imagine it is the way you season them and the baking temperature.  I think things taste better when someone else cooks them a lot of times so maybe there is nothing wrong with them.
402514_4	it's hard to get your food as good as the food in restaurants. the cooks in restaurants are trained professionals  (hopefully). . . NOTE: baked potatoes are the best!!! >.<
402514_5	i LOVE baked potatoes! espesilly with barbeque, cheese, and sour cream. mmmmmmmmmmmm!!!
402514_6	ummm maybe you werent ment to cook
402514_7	try wraping them in foil w/ a tad of butter or when you wash them off. leave a tad of water in the foil or use oil. when i wrap mine. i put butter, a few drops of olive oil and garlic powder on them and bake them in the oven on 350 for 30 mins or so or on the grill. it gives them a crisp skin.
402514_8	Try this for your baked potatoes. Bake them for 1 hour and 30 minutes at 425 degrees. They will come out almost perfect everytime.
3118508_8	Lack of intellgence.  The more intelligence, the less you are confused, the more intelligence, the more you understand.. . However, your question of it having an 'origin' implies to me a confusion of its idea.
1254719_1	I don't know why it smells so bad, but I do know why it is brown.. . The brown coloration is a combination of everything in your stools. The most color-prominent components are bile (yellow, and made by the liver) and dead red blood cells.
1174180_6	Well because it's an Offensive Slang and it's not good to offend people. The question is "Why did you ask it as a question when you already know it's so bad??? Are you trying to offend someone?"

2719866_0	The vitamin A in the whites is very good for your skin. The egg white is also a great overnight home remedy for pimples. For this home remedy for pimples just use a Q-tip to dab the egg-white directly on to the pimple. A home remedy for pimples to get rid of redness for an inflamed pimple is to use visine eye drops and apply to the red spots - leaving on for up to 1 hour, then rinse with water, gently blot dry
2719866_2	i used to break out all the time the best way to get rid of the redness and pimples i found is to wash my face with rubbing alcohol. It will not dry your face. i told all my friends and it worked for them to.
3264650_6	use whitening tooth paste and buy you some crest whitening strips they really work
3264650_18	Alright, use Crest Whitestrips premium and follow the exact package instructions. Also use a mild whitening toothpaste. If you want more immediate results, then use Rembrandt's 2 hour whitening kit and a stronger whitening toothpaste. Finally, try red lipstick, because it makes teeth look whiter. (for everyday, an orangey coral lipgloss can pull it off too.)

4269882_12	It's the Spirit of God.. His thoughts, His emotions, His wisdom, His truth.. . To be born from above, not again, you have to be born of the Spirit.. . Joh 3:3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. . Joh 3:4  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? . Joh 3:5  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. . Joh 3:6  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. . . We all are born of the flesh and water, the womb. . That which is born of the Spirit is spirit, passing from death unto life.
1301592_0	Don't set goals you cannot control  Height is not something you can control in any way.  You will hit growth spurts throughout your life and you may not reach the average height of your family.  You may grow taller than your family.  Don't worry yourself about such things, deal with things within your control and allow nature and genetics to take it's course.

1862777_1	I think that public transit if very important even in today's American society.  Public transit provides important transportation to people that are handicapped, college students, poor, or environmentally minded people.  It is important for public trans to remain in America to help keep the American economy and infrastructure strong.
2534403_0	Easter is the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon and the Paschcal full moon is determined by the date of the first actual full moon that occurs after the vernal equinox (the first day of spirng).. . The date of the Paschal Full Moon can differ from the date of the actual full moon by up to 2 days but will always occur between March 21 and April 18 and so Easter Sunday will fall on or between March 22 and April 19.. . These are the dates for Western Easter Sunday (WES), Orthodox Easter Sunday (OES) can fall on different dates.. . This year WES is on April 16th and OES is on April 23rd, next year it will be 8th April for both WES and OES.

(1). . v[R](t) = R*i(t) . . v[L](t) = L*di/dt. . v[C](t) = 1/C * _/`i*dt (integral i dt). . so, (1) becomes. . R*i(t) + L*di/dt + 1/C*_/`i*dt = v(t). . differentiating above equation,. . R*di/dt + L*d^2i/dt^2 + 1/C * i(t) = dv/dt .... is the required equation
4235462_0	So is somebody finally conceding that the U.S. is a RELIGIOUS government?  Did someone finally read the Constitution and see that we were guaranteed religious freedom, and that the Constitution does not separate Church and State?  The Constitution just says not to set up a State Church, like the Church of England, because they wanted religious FREEDOM!

4375770_7	I keep my cat indoors by putting the fear of God (i.e., me) into her every time she's near a door. Whenever she's close enough to a door to make a dash outside, I yell, stomp on the floor and clap so she'll run off. I've done that enough times that she's afraid to go anywhere near the door now. It's pretty effective.
1097986_0	same as those of us who were on submarines... you sleep when you can.  thos astronauts are so busy up there, that when they get a chance to sleep, i'm sure they take it, no matter what time it's supposed to be.
2592852_0	Because it's either not cold enough or too cold for snow :) We get weather coming mainly from Europe which is hot, with little bits of weather from Scandinavia and Russia which are cold.. . PS. Above freezing all year round my a****, we get snow and it gets to freezing and minus numbers. It needs to be -1, 0 or 1 for snow.. . Scotland gets quite a bit of snow, cos it's nearer Iceland.

2518594_6	It's the way your eyes work.  Your sight isn't really continuous.  Think of it as taking a bunch of pictures really fast, like a strobe light but way faster.  Any way, as a car speeds up, at some point the spokes will appear to be standing still.  At that point they are moving fast enough that your brain is 'taking a picture' each time the wheels make a full rotation.  If they slow down a bit, they will appear to be moving gradually backwards.

2019409_0	The sun shines for the same reason a fire radiate light.. And we need the sun because without it it would be freezing cold outside. In fact the Earth and all the solar system wouldnt exist if the sun wasnt there because there wouldn't the gravitational field the sun provides to gather elements and form planets.
2019409_3	Very hot gases  make the sun shine.  The earth needs the sun to survive because the rays that the sun produces gives heat and light to us.

310696_19	Because people want to blame something. And the media is telling them to blame Islam. . Because there are some people who are just ignorant and dont wnat to know more, they just want to sit back and throw the blame on some one else.. . Then there are the cowards, who move with the wind, if some one blames Islam,  then they join them.. . There are those who love violence and hatred and spread it against Islam...... . Many reasons.

3035489_2	Find out what you want to study, and then research the Canadian universities to find out which fits you best.  For example if you were interested in physics/astronomy you may want to consider the University of Victoria, or the University of Toronto.
1875767_1	Because people like Jane Fonda (and other so called stars and people in the public eye) were very vocal about their displeasure. Instead of being proud of our soldiers, they slammed a decision that was out of the solders hands and basically punished them for doing what they told to do.. . Also, Natalie from the Dixie Chicks did the same thing. I loved the Dixie Chicks music, but after her stupid remark have you noticed the radio stations quit playing their songs. Too bad.  People need to think before they spout off!

688359_5	Because everyone is in a rush to get home and get on the road at same time so they can't.. . And why do they call it a driveway when you park on it?. Why do they call it a parkway when you drive on it?
636973_1	explain what you mean by weed out.. in the mean time i am going to assume you mean that they put people on academic probation then they have to leave if they don't get their grades up.  Well public or private colleges have a reputation.  Some schools may be a little easier to get into but  they  want to leave you there if your grades are bad.  The reason is they don't want to get a reputation of being a high school, easy school or party school.  So they have academic standards that you have to follow once you get there
636973_2	Maybe it will select the students who  go to class, do the homework, read the text book, and study. As opposed to people who watch TV, smoke the weed, and hang in internet chat rooms. Admissions just select students with the potential, classes weed out the slackers. MIKE

1290612_0	I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was eighteen, now I am 25 and things are better.  When I first started to have anxiety I would get depressed because I felt like everything was wrong with me.  I didn't feel like myself and I would be afraid to do the usual things I did.
1290612_1	Yes they do because the same chemicals produce too much or too less in both and often they are caused by the same things like genes and family history of the disease. But if you really think about it they do relate.
1290612_2	Please visit my anxiety page
1290612_3	When you are depressed you don't seem to find the way out.  . Anxiety arouses because of the lack of that way out.. It is also due to physical and phisiologic changes in the body.  They don't 'seem to' they coexist... those cases in which they don't coexist are very odd.
1290612_4	Because we let them. Think of happy things when you are low. Get outside in the fresh air (trust me it will help).  Drink a coke or fruit juice, NO BOOZE. I have gone through bad times and this helped me.
1290612_5	Anxiety and depression usually go together bc when aperson is depressed alot of the times they have symptoms of anxiety like worrying about sthing over nad over and that goes with depression bc when you are depressed you worry alot and are sad constantly.
1290612_6	They are both related to the imbalance of serotonin in your brain. Thus similar medications treat both.. . "An organic compound, C10H12N2O, formed from tryptophan and found in animal and human tissue, especially the brain, blood serum, and gastric mucous membranes, and active as a neurotransmitter and in vasoconstriction, stimulation of the smooth muscles, and regulation of cyclic body processes."

141219_1	Adolescent males usually continue to grow taller through age 18. You are not finished yet. . . 'Normal' height range for a 16 year old boy is 63 to 73 inches. You are 56 inches so are well within 'normal range' If you maintain your current growth rate you can expect to reach an approximate height of 5'10" assuming you started puberty at about 12.5 years. . If you had a late onset of puberty (later than 12.5 years) you can expect to grow taller for longer. Men tend to grow taller for about 5 or 5.5 years after onset of puberty.
2862887_0	Most of the "Dragons" are bearded, chinese, or giant mountain horned lizards. You can give them crickets, meal worms, wax worms, red wigglers, try to also give some romain lettuce, shredded beets, shredded cucumbers, with a little peach baby food as a "salad dressing"
2862887_1	live crickets are the best choice in food.  Make sure the full size of the cricket is smaller than the mouth.  You should also mist them with water a few days a week as well as giving them some sort of water dish.  Handle them regularly or they can become aggressive.

2949791_3	as a liberal, i am concerned about the national debt because first of all there wasn't one going into the Bush administration. Second, i don't agree with spending $150 billion dollars a year on a war for oil rather than spending it on improving education which is in desparate need of a reform. And I do not agree with spending any money to kill or have people killed as we are doing in the war in Afghanistan, Iraq, and now our reconissance troops in Iran. As far as sources go, you can find them on your own. I dont need to do your research for you.

3100319_0	I'm afraid you can't spot reduce fat - for example, working on your legs by running will burn more calories than if you got no exercise, and you will hopefully lose overall body fat. However your genes determine where you will lose the fat from - keep the exercise up and eat healthily and you will lose total body fat, including at your knees.

2074044_3	I think the answer to this question is to (1) read the whole insurance policy and (2) make sure you disclose absolutely everything so as not to get caught out.. . If you are getting a loan/mortgage, some mortgage companies require that you insure against loss/damage etc. therefore you have to have insurance.  If you don't have insurance then there is absolutely no way to possibly protect yourself.. . Also, in the UK you have to have insurance for cars so there is no choice in the matter.

270342_3	I work in auto insurance--go with a larger company, the small ones either charge more or you're not getting all the coverage you think you are.  larger vehicles are cheaper on insurance ( I know it doesn't make sense, but trust me.  I do this every day).  Keep your record clean, accident- and violation-wise.  Being married helps.  Have other business with the company, like Life or property insurance.
1063812_0	Not at this age.
1063812_1	sorry, you have passed that PUBERTY AGE!
1063812_2	NOPE - if you're 26 you stopped growing a long time ago.  Sorry theres nothing you can do.
1063812_3	Ask your doctor (or eager friends) to stretch you!
1063812_4	guys have reached their adult height by 23...sorry
1063812_5	sorry babe, men quit growing by 21. maybe u should have asked this ?? sooner
1063812_6	unfortunately no, you cannot increase your height, expecially ar 26 years of age. your best bet is to take oral growth hormones to increase bone length,to add a few minute inches.
1063812_7	talk to a doctor but i don't really think your that short
1063812_8	no, men stop growing at 21 or 22. So, wear some high heels
1063812_9	Talk to your Doctor about steroids. There are safe ones that they can get you on to help you grow. I think they might actually be hormone/steroid stuff, at any rate talk to your doc. If you can't afford 'em, buy 'em off that black market. just kidding
1063812_10	lol. noper, im 15 and i am at 5'11 no growing taller, though i did see an add on imech6 that garunteed growth up to 5 inches in a year some kinda of democroitec steroid, i wouldnt use it , i dont know what it was called, though sorry

1063812_12	sorry ur past growing years....
1063812_13	I don't think it's possible but, I went to a site that thinks it is. Check it out. www.growingtaller.net or just put in the words growing taller and a few sites do pop up. Good Luck!

1063812_15	ever see the movie Gattaca? Etahn Hawke and the lovely Uma Thurman. The procedure does exist. They break your legs clean and strech them slowly using braces to hold them in place. Months, if not years. Hope you won the lottery too. You're gonna need it.
1063812_16	i think there's this procedure where they break your legs and put some sort of brace on it..pretty morbid,but if you're desperate,that's the way to go.
2484180_0	The media has to take the blame as well all the mamma boys out there.. . You are right your dog and the other kind of PITT PULL scaredy cats out there who don't know anything about dogs let alone this breed.
2484180_1	If your dog always showing his teeth like the one on your profile, of course people will naturally think he is aggressive.
2484180_2	for the same reason humans judge other humans
2484180_3	Because of the negative publicity about some breeds of dogs.  Also how does your dog react to people?  If the tail is wagging and the mouth is snarling, growling, or barking, I'll believe the end with the teeth!
2484180_4	Yeah, pit bulls are great dogs. I blame the media and irresponsible owners for creating the pit bull's image problems. Combine that with increased dog fighting over the last few years and breeders who have no idea what they're doing and you can see what's going wrong. Plus, the commodification of pets (and pits in particular) doesn't help either.. . Dumb people + dogs = problems
2484180_5	i dont know but they shouldnt...just being someone has a bad experience with one type of dog doesnt mean that all dogs that breed are the same...some people are dumb
2484180_6	because if he looks like a giant rat he will most likely repel people.
2484180_7	I do not know why they do this. I know that Pit Bulls get a bad rep and I don't think that's right. I have a Pit bull and she is the friendliest dog I have to everybody! Beats me though. I guess it is for the same reason they judge people by their looks.
2484180_8	just like they judge people by their looks.
2484180_9	'cause people are stupid.. . All dogs are beautiful.
2484180_10	Because it is our human nature to judge everything we see.
2484180_11	People are terrified in general.. . Your dog just makes them scared because he looks like he would be more than they could handle in a physical confrontation.  Therfore they fear and scare your dog with their fear.
3211683_12	If child sexual abuse is not effectively treated, long-term symptoms may persist into adulthood. These may include:. . PTSD and/or anxiety . Depression and thoughts of suicide . Sexual anxiety and disorders . Poor body image and low self-esteem . The use of unhealthy behaviors, such as alcohol abuse, drug abuse, self-mutilation, or bingeing and purging, to help mask painful emotions related to the abuse . If you were abused as a child and suffer from any of these symptoms, it may help you to get help from a mental-health professional who has expertise in working with people who have been sexually abused
2535337_5	I agree with you..I don't understand it.. No explanations could convince me : saving energy ??? (yeah..in winter ? going behind ??).

2016358_3	Battery in series arrangement will have a combined voltage(force) to push more current to the bulb.. For simple analogy, It is similar to water level in a narrow container gaining pressure at the bottom the more you add water. Parallel arragement is similar to increasing the volume of water without changing it's height thus maintaing the same pressure at the bottom.
2529760_0	You have to cook it to at least 165 degrees to be at a safe temperature for eating because that way it kills all the bacteria that could possibly be in it.. . I think about 325-350 degrees is about right as far as the heat used to cook the chicken.  Any less than that and it will take forever to cook; any more than that and it will just burn the outside and not cook the inside very well.
1034818_0	Valve cover gaskets were a common source of oil leaks onto the exhaust manifolds of older American cars and would produce the smoke you describe. If you truly have a "carburetor", it sounds like that's your problem.
1034818_6	because when you're car is moving or the engine is running, air is forced over the engine, blowing the smoke away. when you're still, it collects and you can see it coming from under the hood.
3136566_1	its just another attck by islam against non-muslims... this is not a Israel vs. (so-called) palestinian event, this is part of a much larger and older event dating back 1400 years since the begining of islam. This is also a world wide event with terrorism from muslims happening in over 28 seperate countries that have nothing to do with eachother except for the fact that they are all under attack from the same people, with the same idology. . There has never EVER been a nation, state, or country of palestine AND when from 48-67 ARABS occupied the land they now claim for yet ANOTHER arab/muslim state (gaza, half of jeruslam, and west bank) NO STATE WAS MADE! this has never been about a fake people called palestinians (who are simply arabs, no different in anyway) this is about intollerance for a single jewish state of isreal on a planet with 57 muslim states.. the hammas and "palestinian" authority are simply pawns in a game, and no different than the people who flew planes in 9/11 or shot 300 russian kids, or attack hindus in India, or murder hundreds of thousands of christians in sudan or.. (the list is just too long)

1783010_0	It's where you use something religious sarcastically. Like on the show Rescue Me on FX, they had Jesus play a part on there that didn't act at all like Jesus. That's blasphemy.
1783010_1	saying something that goes against god and his teaching. Like disrespect
1783010_2	Blasphemy is anything that curses God or goes against the tenet of a religion.
1783010_3	I think you meant Blasphemy. And it is the defamation of the name of god. Such as insulting or showing contempt or lack of reverence for god or something considered sacred or inviolable. This would include Using the name of god in vain such as curse words or swear words or saying that god does not exist or that his teachings are false. . . Some diehard Christians, Jews and Muslims believe that gust saying, "god" or typing the entire word "god" is considered blasphemy. They believe it should always be capitalized and the "o" omitted such as "G-D". Many other Christians believe that the name of god should never be used for anything but prayer.  Muslims in particular are against the use of any of gods names, other then Allah, a tile just like god.  Most Christians, Jews and Muslims see my spelling of the word god with a lowercase 'g' as being blasphemous. But I do this because I do not believe in a god. That too is blasphemous. Oh well. You can npt please them all.. . I hope this helps.
1783010_4	Deny the existance of God
1783010_5	disrespecting the holy spirit.....
1783010_6	Think of this way. It's like writing spiritual checks without God's endorsement. "God will bless me with a new car". Unless that new car for you is based on scriptual basis then that statement is blaphsemy.
1783010_7	IT'S FUN, FUN, FUN. ESPECIALLY WHEN BIBLETHUMPERS ARE AROUND!
1783010_8	It's difficult to say. One person's holy doctrine is another's blasphemy. For instance for me blasphemy is god sending himself to die on a Roman cross to save his children from himself.
1783010_9	1: a: the act of insulting or showing contempt or lack of reverence for God b : the act of claiming the attributes of deity. 2 : irreverence toward something considered sacred or inviolable   . . ... basically saying god damnit, god is dead, or something to that effect in today's society.
1783010_10	insulting God or his  religion.
1783010_11	Making fun of a serious aspect of religion
1783010_12	f*** god... thats balasphemy.
1783010_13	yea what melissa said!
1783010_14	Blasphsemy of The Holy Spirit is when one is brought up before the synagog of satan and refuse to let the Holy spirit speak through them for a witness against the false one.  This is a specific time that this can only be done.  It is when the anti-INSTEAD of Christ is here sitting where he ought not.  Those who STAND against him will be called up before him and tested ten days.  These are Gods Elect who will let God speak through them as a testimony against the false one.  Gods elect will never commit blasphemy against God.  They love God and want to do His will.  It is said that blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is the unforgivable sin.  God forgives ALL sin. This is said because God knows His own and He knows He can trutst them to stand before the evil one and to let Him speak through them.
1783010_15	It is a victimless crime!
1783010_16	blasphemy is attributing God's qualities to someone or something else.
1783010_17	Definition of blasphemy - . . - A contemptuous or profane act, utterance, or writing concerning God or a sacred entity.. - The act of claiming for oneself the attributes and rights of God.. - An irreverent or impious act, attitude, or utterance in regard to something considered inviolable or sacrosanct.. .

2852637_3	taco bell is not a global dinning chain as of yet. you see, to have sucess selling food in forgen countrys the resteraunt has to hire a hole new set of reps to focus on what that paticular country would like to see.. such as mcdonalds for example. they have hired people specificly to relate to the children in other countrys so that they can have toys that they want. they aslo specialize the menue. so that it includes regional foods. apparently taco bell hasnet gone up to that standard yet, just wait, i'm sure it will get there eventualy!. so if you really want taco bell.. then i would suggest coming to america for a week or so just to check out our not so great fast food!

3074429_1	If muslims would stop acting like they act in Iran.. . Well, a lot of them are nice, but there are some bad guys too.. And burning buildings gives people a negative image of islam.
3074429_2	By first, not killing them.
3074429_3	put them in a zoo and study them
3074429_4	Do research about their culture and about their religion, its the best way. I am not a muslim but I understand them, and Its not good to treat muslims differently because of the political problems arising from US and other Muslim countries. ISLAM is a sweet religion, you have to learn how to separate religion from POLITICS. GROW UP man.
3074429_5	I believe the first step would be to realize that, like Christians, there are many, many different groups that would identify themselves as Muslim.  For example, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Baptists, and even the Branch Davidians in Waco all would consider themselves to be Christian.  . . Realizing that, you would have to consider which group of Muslims (people) you were trying to understand.  Take a good look at their situation.  Their actions, if they are Muslims, that is to say if they are Islamic, should be supported by, or justified by the Koran (the Holy Book of Islam).  . . I think that some peoples actions, commonly attributed to Muslims or Islam, could also be resulting from other factors.  I have read the Koran (in English) and it is mostly very similiar to reading the Bible in that It is a Message or a lesson from or about God.  Jesus is there and the Virgin Mary, too.  Alot of the same stories or themes,   and God, who is the same are in both Books. There are some parts that would seem wrong or strange or even quite different, but mostly, very similar.
3074429_6	By reading the Koran.  Muslims often claim their religion is very close to Christianity.  It is actually diametrically opposed.  They deny the divinity of Jesus.  More important, perhaps, is that the primary focus of Christianity is forgiveness, while the primary focus of Islam is revenge.  Personally the true tenets of Islam make me rather sick.  And I've talked to enough of them in person to know Love is not the basis of that particular religion.
3074429_7	Live with them. Spend time in their culture. Born in Texas, I lived in Iran as a child, for 5 years, up until age 7(1979- Fall of the Shah of Iran, rise of Ayatholla Khomeni). I grew up and watched an Islamic revolution tear a nation apart...or bring it together against a common enemy- depending on your view point. Since I [Americans] was the enemy, it skewed my judgement to think that they were wrong. But, do we not also make outcast those who dont agree with us? First hand experience is my answer at the core.
3074429_8	I have written a book which is kind of an introduction to islam. You can check it at spaces.msn.com/slimayn . The book chapters are on the list to the right. Peace be with you.

899118_0	Eyelid twitches/spasms are generally caused by muscle fatigue.  It may be due to eye strain from such conditions as poor lighting, lack of sleep, undiagnosed vision problem or a need for a new lens prescription.  Potassium, as in bananas, is a better treatment for muscle spasms (and cramping) than calcium because while calcium helps regulate muscle contraction, potassium helps regulate both muscle contraction AND muscle excitability.

2207257_7	9/11 wasnt a terrorist attack, it was a controlled demolition executed with military precision used as an excuse to go into afghanastan, in turn heading to Iraq to finish the job that George H W Bush started. Not to mention its a damn good place for a forward military base. Open you eyes America.
2207257_8	Yeah, I think the only people who are using 9/11 as an excuse for this war are the Bush Administration.  Pretty much everyone else knows why we are in Iraq.  amazing, isn't it.

666247_2	Germination is the process in botany where growth emerges from a resting stage. The most common example of germination is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of a flowering plant or gymnosperm. However, the growth of a hypha from a fungal spore is also germination. In a more general sense, germination can imply anything expanding into greater being from a small existence or germ.
3774373_18	Bones and cells definitely plays a big role in determining the height of individuals but I don't think they provide a clear answer as to why guys are usually taller than gals.. Here is my opinion...They way I see it, men and women are just equal in the height department. That means women can grow as tall as any men can. It only seem like there are more women who are shorter than men because you commonly see them walking around in pairs, and as you know very well, our society dictates that it's ideal to have a taller guy in a relationship than a taller girl. . But Try to check out tha physical stature of guys and girls from an asian country for a change. And compare the height of the asian males to those of caucasian females.You'll see that there are more taller caucasian females than asian males! Proving that it is not really true that guys are actually taller than women.It depends on a lot of factors really, ANd sometimes you just gotta look at it from a different perspective in order to see what is not obvious.
2199269_1	the Finnish government recently funded a brain scanning study. The results turned up some hard-to-interpret, possible clues. It also confirmed the obvious: yawn contagion is largely unconscious. Wherever it might affect the brain, it bypasses the known brain circuitry for consciously analyzing and mimicking other people’s actions..        This circuitry is called the “mirror-neuron system,” because it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing. .        Mirror neurons typically become active when a person consciously imitates an action of someone else, a process associated with learning. But they seem to play no role in yawn contagiousness, the researchers in the new study found. The cells are have no extra activity during contagious yawning compared with during other non-contagious facial movements, they observed..       Brain activity “associated with viewing another person yawn seems to circumvent the essential parts of the MNS [mirror neuron system], in line with the nature of contagious yawns as automatically released behavioural acts—rather than truly imitated motor patterns that would require detailed action understanding,” wrote the researchers, with the Helsinki University of Technology and the Research Centre Jülich, Germany. The findings are published in the February issue of the research journal Neuroimage..       But if seeing someone yawn doesn’t activate these centers, what does it do to the brain? The researchers found that it appears to strongly activate at least one brain area, called the superior temporal sulcus. But this activation was unrelated to any desire to yawn in response, so it may be irrelevant to the contagion question, the researchers added..        Possibly more significant, they wrote, was the apparent deactivation of a second brain area, called the left periamygdalar region. The more strongly a participant reported wanting to yawn in response to another person’s yawn, the stronger was this deactivation. .       “This finding represents the first known neurophysiological signature of perceived yawn contagiousness,” the researchers wrote.. Exactly what the finding means is less clear, they acknowledged. The periamygdalar region is a zone that lies alongside the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep in the brain in the area of the side of the head. The periamygdalar region has been linked to the unconscious analysis of emotional expressions in faces. Why it would be deactivated in tandem with yawn contagion is unclear, the researchers said..        One thing seems clear from the study is that “contagious yawning does not rely on brain mechanisms of action understanding,” wrote one of the researchers, Riitta Hari of the Helsinki University of Technology, in a recent email. Rather, she continued, it seems to be an “‘automatically’ released (and most likely very archaic) motor pattern,” or sequence of physical actions..          In the study, volunteers looked at videos of actors yawning or making other mouth movements. Meanwhile their brains were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a system that shows the amount of activity or work going on in various brain areas based on the amount of oxygen being used up there. The volunteers were later asked how strongly they had been tempted to yawn while viewing the pictures..       Apart from the physical brain mechanisms of yawn contagiousness, researchers have offered different reasons as to why it exists. Some have proposed that in early humans, yawn contagiousness might have helped people communicate their alertness levels to each other, and thus coordinate their sleep schedules..        This might be part of a more general phenomenon of unconscious signals that serve to synchronize group behavior, the authors of the Neuroimage paper wrote. “Such synchronization could be essen

1461587_0	Easter is the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon and the Paschcal full moon is determined by the date of the first actual full moon that occurs after the vernal equinox (the first day of spirng).. . The date of the Paschal Full Moon can differ from the date of the actual full moon by up to 2 days but will always occur between March 21 and April 18 and so Easter Sunday will fall on or between March 22 and April 19.. . These are the dates for Western Easter Sunday (WES), Orthodox Easter Sunday (OES) can fall on different dates.. . This year WES is on April 16th and OES is on April 23rd, next year it will be 8th April for both WES and OES.

1628352_14	I would geuss, being a fellow teenager, is that it really is only the bad ones who make the news.  I would also venture to geuss that the good ones have some flaw, and since most other teenagers are bad, the flaws are emphasized, and the teenager's good parts aren't being brought to attention.
1628352_18	I like teenagers. I think they're funny and cute; fun to watch. But, you're right, only the bad ones make the news.

This causes a characteristic 'hiccup' sound and the spasms can repeat continuously for several minutes." . There are various cures, sometimes contradictory, ranging from holding your breath to breathing deeply and slowly, to drinking upside down. See this website for a description of various cures.

3694941_0	Some white smoke coming out the tail pipe is normal. It is actually steam that is coming out and the reason it does that is because the catalytic converter is actually doing its job in oxidizing the poisonous gases that come out.

3694941_2	It's probably normal.. . "Question: 1995 BMW 525i. My BMW is always giving off white smoke. I noticed it does not overheat or anything like that. The outside temperature is 38 deg F. All the other cars are running fine. Sometimes I smell coolant inside the car but have been unable to find a wet spot in the car. Help.. . Answer: White smoke when first started is normal. If white smoke continues you have an internal coolant leak, i.e., cracked head/blown head gasket. Black smoke is caused by a rich fuel condition. Blue smoke is caused by oil consumption. The smell of coolant inside your car is caused by a leaking heater core."

360796_0	Unless the chicken is already fried, you can't make an authetic parmesan.  Frying chicken that's already fully cooked, unless perhaps it's dark meat, will dry it out and even though you put sauce on it to bake, it will still be dry inside.. . If, however, your fried chicken is dark meat (and hopefully boneless), you can put it cold into your baking pan and add cheese and sauce and bake it.. . I would recommend though that you preheat your oven first and make sure your sauce and cheese are all at least room temperature (preheating the sauce in a pan or the microwave would be better) so that the parmesan will not have to bake too long to prevent overcooking the chicken.

1258084_14	My dear person...If you are trying to get away with as much as you can you certainly must not be "born again"  A Christian is not exempt from sinning but has an advocate with the Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, our Lord...He took all our sins to the cross and forgiveness comes through belief in Christ...Christ says, "No man cometh unto the Father, except through me (Christ)" Don't you want to please a God who gave His Son to die,on a cross, so you could be saved?  I'll pray for you...

1825763_0	Yawns are not contagious. One yawns for need of extra Oxygen to the lungs and for no other reason.
1825763_2	experiments suggest that contagious yawning is related to a person's self-awareness and ability to see things from another person's view. In the words of Dr. Platek and his colleagues:. . "Seeing or hearing about another person yawn may tap a primitive neurological substrate responsible for self-awareness and empathic modeling which produces a corresponding response in oneself.". The researchers also suggest that animals, such as chimpanzees and orangutans, who are capable of self-recognition and mental state attribution should be susceptible to contagious yawns. Perhaps you can make some observations of such behavior the next time you are at the zoo.

168586_0	An old home remedy is to put duct tape over it and leave it on till the tape falls off.  You may have to do this more than once.  After a while-could take several weeks, the wart will be gone.  Tried this on my daughter and it actually worked!
3838916_1	How much water are you talking about?  If someone has put water in your tank, you might have to drop the tank and remove the water.  On some cars you can enter the tank thru the vent line, and pump the water out.  In some cases, the water might have entered your exhaust system.  Which means you have to open your exhaust sys to warm the engine to operating temperature.  Once the car is running you can then reconnect your exhaust and blow the water out of it.. . Good Luck
50083_1	First of all, do not ever bite a wart. Warts are viruses, you can spread a virus. If you don't want to or can't afford to go see a dermatologist, either buy an over the counter Compound W, or you can use an old-time remedy of occluding the wart with duct tape. Eventually it will shrink and go away.
50083_7	cut a piece of duct tape to fit over the wart, and leave it on for a few days.  when you peel off the duct tape the wart will fall off with it.

2799913_2	just let your feelings out
2799913_3	"I'm so sorry.  He/She was a great person."  Usually, the grieveing people are so upset, they won;t even remember what you said anyway.  Just be sincere.
2799913_4	I would say not to worry about what to say to them, they are not looking for the perfect answer, or comment.  It just shows respect to the family that you cared enough to be there.  Just a simple I'm sorry, is sufficient.  When I lost my son and people tried to say comforting things alot of things came out wrong, I am sure it bothered them after they said them and thought about it.  But anyway, just say I'm sorry and then move on don't stand there and try to make conversation. Not only do the bereaved not really feel like trying to think of something to say but there is usually alot of people in line waiting to pay their respects.

3123658_0	Grinding your teeth will not cause strep throat.  It's a bacterial infection and extremely contagious.  If you are in close proximity to someone with strep throat, you might catch it.
3123658_3	What is strep throat?. Strep throat is a bacterial infection of the tissues in the back of the throat and the tonsils. The tissues become irritated and inflamed, causing a sudden, severe sore throat.. . What causes strep throat?. Strep throat is caused by streptococcal (strep) bacteria. There are many different strains of strep bacteria, some of which cause more serious illness than others. The type of strep that most commonly infects the throat is called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABS).. . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. . Strep throat is most common in the late fall, winter, and early spring. The infection is spread by person-to-person contact with nasal secretions or saliva, often among family or household members.. . People with strep throat get sick an average of 3 days after they are exposed. (The range is 2"5 days.) The illness usually begins suddenly, with a fever that peaks on the second day. Many also have sore throat, headache, stomachache, nausea, or chills.. . In some people, strep throat is very mild, with only a few of these symptoms. In others, strep throat is severe. There are many strains of strep. Some strains produce toxins that can lead to a scarlet fever rash. This rash is thought to be an allergic reaction to these toxins. Untreated, strep throat can sometimes lead to rheumatic fever. Kidney complications are among the other possibilities
3123658_4	(m). . Strep throat is an infection caused by group A streptococcus bacteria, and it's very common among kids and teens. The symptoms of strep throat include fever, stomach pain, and red, swollen tonsils.. . Strep throat usually requires treatment with antibiotics. With the proper medical care - along with plenty of rest and fluids - your child should be back to school and play within a few days.. . Diagnosing Strep Throat . If your child's throat is sore and he or she has other strep throat symptoms, it's a good idea to call your child's doctor. The doctor will likely do a rapid strep test in the office, using a cotton swab to take a sample of the fluids at the back of your child's throat. The test only takes about 5 minutes. If it's positive, your child has strep throat. If the test is negative, the doctor will send a sample to a lab for a throat culture. The results are usually available within a few days.. . Treating Strep Throat. In most cases, doctors prescribe about 10 days of antibiotic medication to treat strep throat. Within about 24 hours after your child starts taking the antibiotics, his or her temperature will probably be back to normal, and your child will no longer be contagious. By the second or third day after taking antibiotics, the other symptoms should start to go away, too. . . Even though your child may not feel sick at that point, it's very important that he or she finish the antibiotic prescription. If your child stops taking antibiotics too soon, bacteria can remain in the throat and the symptoms can return.. . If your child is not treated for strep throat, he or she is most infectious when the symptoms are the most severe but could remain contagious for up to 21 days. Lack of treatment - or not finishing the prescribed course of antibiotics - also could put your child at risk for other health problems, such as rheumatic fever (which can cause permanent damage to the heart), scarlet fever, blood infections, or kidney disease.. . To prevent your sick child from spreading strep throat to others in your home, keep his or her eating utensils, dishes, and drinking glasses separate from those that everyone else is using. Wash them in hot, soapy water after each use. Also, make sure your child doesn't share food, drinks, napkins, handkerchiefs, or towels with other family members. Make sure your child covers his or her mouth and nose during a sneeze or a cough to prevent passing infectious fluid droplets to someone else.. . Caring for Your Child With Strep Throat. There's plenty you can do to help your child feel better. To prevent dehydration, make sure your child drinks plenty of cool liquids, such as water or ginger ale, especially if he or she has had a fever. Avoid orange juice, grapefruit juice, lemonade, or other acidic beverages, which may irritate your child's throat. Warm liquids like soups, tea with honey, or hot chocolate can be soothing.. . As your child starts to feel better, talk to your child's doctor about the best time to return to school and other routine activities.
204963_0	If it's in relation to the size of something then it would mean 5 units long by 5 units wide.. .

271592_0	initial symptoms of "mono" are:. . a general lack of energy or malaise, . a loss of appetite, and . chills. . These initial symptoms can last from one to three days before the more intense symptoms of the illness begin. The more common intense symptoms include:. . a severe sore throat, . fever, and . swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck area. . It is generally the severe sore throat that prompts people to contact their doctor. . . What are the signs of "mono?" . . In addition to a fever from 102 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, the most common signs of "mono" are:. . a very reddened throat and tonsils and . swollen lymph glands in the neck. . The tonsils have a whitish coating in at least one third of the cases. The spleen, (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest lymph node), is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the ribcage which becomes enlarged or swollen in about 50% of patients with "mono." An enlarged liver may also occur. About 5% of patients have a splotchy red rash over the body, which has a similar appearance to the rash of measles. . . How is "mono" diagnosed? . . The diagnosis of "mono" is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. "Mono" is confirmed by blood tests while testing to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Early in the course of the illness, blood tests show an increase in a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or "atypical" lymphocytes, which suggest "mono." More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of "mono." These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function. Testing to exclude the possibility of a strep throat is also considered for some patients.

My two oldest boys had gotten warts all over their hands and I had a 7th son rub them off. About 6 weeks later, I had forgotten about it and went to take the boys to the doctor to get rid of them before school started, and the youngest one's warts were gone. The oldest didn't believe they'd be gone and they weren't but the youngest did believe. It really works. Another thing is go to your doctor and ask him or her to use crushed up blister beetle on the wart, it'll go away in about a week. Good luck

746920_9	Grandfather Gus returned with a tin of grease, and my grandmother spread it freely over the wound. The bleeding stopped immediately and in a few hours she cleaned the wound, dabbed it with a little coal oil, and tied a strip of white cloth around my chest.. . If you grew up in the country, miles away from the nearest doctor, home remedies were something you accepted routinely. Using axle grease or coal oil for cuts probably made pretty good sense, especially if you got well.. . In 1996, we completed "Rub Onions and Skunk Oil on my Chest and Call Me Well," a collection of home remedies and folk medicines. Most of the contributions came from older people who used the folk remedies themselves or remembered parents or grandparents who found the home medicines an essential part of rural life in Texas. We discovered a multitude of cures for warts, but they often fell more into the realm of superstition than remedies.. . Several people told us to rub our warts with a rooster comb, and bury it.. . Ruby Yount of Lufkin said her mother-in-law removed several warts from her kids' hands, and it was all done in privacy. She tied a knot of sewing thread over the wart, then went outside and buried it in the earth. By the time the thread rotted, the wart was gone

1798931_0	Hydrogen is not used in aircrafts. It is prefered in spacecrafts.. 1. It has high efficiency.. 2. Its waste products are not toxic, but water..      Even eco-friendly car (Toyota) uses the same fuel. They are planning to produce cars also based on this technology..      But cars are to be handled carefully as a small ignition problem can create an explosion.
143833_0	The difference is, coolant is the liquid that curculates through your engine and radiator to cool the engine. Anti freeze is a component of most but not all coolants.Diesel engines use a special antifreeze called Dow Therm. Suzuki motorcycle engines use oil in their engine cooling systems in some of their road bikes like the Intruder line. Auto motive antifreeze must not be put in your cooling system by itself.It is made to be mixed with water to work properly.I usually mix it 50/50 which will protect from freezing to -40 F.
143833_1	It's the same thing dude!
143833_2	They are the same thing. It just does two jobs. It keeps the engine cool in the summer, thus coolant. It keeps he engine from freezing in cold weather, thus antifreeze.
143833_3	While your at the store getting your coolant and antifreeze, dont forget to get your headlight fluid, get a new radiater belt.. . THEY ARE THE SAME THING!!!! im a girl and i knew that!!
143833_4	just make sure whatever you're using says "for automobile use".  It should be Ethylene Glycol.  Some people say coolant and others say antifreeze.  Go with the chemical name:   you can't go wrong.
143833_5	There is no difference. It is the same substance. It has two different names because it does two different things for your car. It cools it when it's running. And in the winter, it is specially designed not to freeze. If it froze your engine block and radiator would split open.
143833_6	Coolant IS the more proper term.  Ethylene glycol and, more recently propylene glycol do both perform as anti-freeze, but only when the temperature is below 32 degrees F.. . But whenever your engine is up to operating temperature the mixture in the cooling system performs as coolant.  The obvious task is to cool the engine and carry the heat to the radiator.  But another overlooked function of either of the glycols is to help raise the boiling point of the water.  Remember in science class...anything added to water like that will lower freezing point and also raise boiling point as well.  The pressure cap on the radiator keeps the pressure at from 7 to 15 p. s. i. which increases the boiling point as well.  That way all your water will not boil away quickly.
143833_7	"Coolant" is the liquid in the radiator.  It may be pure water, pure antifreeze, or, more commonly, a mixture of the two.. . "Antifreeze" is something added to water to lower its freezing point.  For cars and trucks, it is almost always the liquid ethylene glycol.
2065163_1	A yawn is caused by a decreased level of oxygen in your blood.  By taking a deep breath (yawning), more oxygen is going from the air into your blood stream.  When you are tired, your body starts breathing slower.  By yawning, you make up for the decreased levels in oxygen.  I'm not exactly sure on why they are contagious, but it's probably due to a psychological response.  Kind of like when you're sitting at lunch and one person takes a drink.  If you watch for it, other people will take a drink shortly after wards.

2893666_8	What did you want them to say?  To say "sorry" is a shortened way of saying you have feelings of sorrow.  If you tell someone a relative died, it is appropriate to express the idea that your feelings are understood and shared.  It's called sympathy.  Sure, sometimes it is only said to be polite or to avoid hurting your feelings, but even then, it is the right thing for people to do.

4036993_4	Humans are the way they are not because God gets a blast out of watching us screw ourselves up; quite the opposite. God is hurt by us screwing ourselves up. We were initially created in Eden to be a companion to God in His newly created world. We were larger in statue and lived MUCH longer. What has caused us to be in our "current state" is sin. Since sin entered the world we have "de-volved". Sin causes self-centeredness, hate, deception, etc.

361418_1	Abscisic acid is a hormone that acts to prevent germination of seeds.  Within a ripening fruit the dominant hormone is a gas called ethylene.  Once the seed is outside the fruit the levels of abscisic acid (ABA) determine germination time.  In mature plants ABA is involved in the plant's response to water stresses such as drought, where it acts to limit water loss from leaves by promoting closure of wholes called stomata.

3538240_5	Now what do race has to do in a simple question like this. If you took the black and white part out the question could be why do some people like cold weather and other people like warmer weather? Personally I like warmer weather because I'm from the Caribbeans, therefore I have never experienced very cold weather before I came to the USA. It's just what I'm used to not because I'm black or white. The countries that have colder weather seems to have more whites is all. Besides some white people do like warm weather and some black like cold weather. So you see, skin color is not the point. Not the point at all.

The heating effect is usually uneven and spreads from the side facing the source of infrared radiation to the opposite side.  Some materials absorb IR more readily than others, hence the so-called "greenhouse effect".  The glass of the greenhouse absorbs little of the IR directed at it but the interior heats quite effectively in full sunlight.  Hope that helps.

1757874_0	Hate to break your Easter egg, but "Easter Sunday" is not truly redundant, but rather a clarification for more precise language.  . . Easter:  Easter is a more generic term that can apply to the entire season of the church year that lasts fifty days.  The term, "Easter Sunday" would therefore be the precise method of designating which day of the fifty day period we are talking about, much as "Christmas Day" designates December 25 from the more generic Christmas season. (Beginning to look a lot like "Christmas", "Christmas" time, getting ready for "Christmas", etc.). . As for 12 noon and 12 midnight, this is probably more a function of the need for colloquial redundancy in our spoken language (yes, I realize that was redundant) and also the fact that we are often designating morning or evening for the times we give -- 3 in the afternoon, 3 in the morning, so we act out of habit.  Much of our language is redundant so that we can effectively communicate.  Just think how small the information of this paragraph actually is when reduced electronically because of its redundancy.  It doesn't mean that I should type this out in ones and zeros however.  Information theory has exposed just how redundant our language is and how important reduncancy is for accuracy and clarity.. . As for the hot water heater, you probably never took a science class or you would realize that thermodynamics requires the hot water to be heated or it will get cold.. . Oh and one more thing, I'm a proponent of redundancy since it enhances clarity, but isn't it redundant to write the following:  "Either midnight or noon will suffice, I'm well aware that it's 12 either way."  You could have said: "Either midnight or noon will suffice." or "I'm well aware that it's 12 either way."  Aren't those pretty much the same thing?. . Happy Easter Sunday.
1757874_6	There are 2 days which use the term Easter-Easter Sunday and Easter Monday (the day after 'Easter').  Although the Sunday is always the day that Easter itself is actually celebrated, the Monday is often a holiday.  Maybe you should try looking at it another way, rather than the term Easter Sunday describing Easter as being on a Sunday, it may be describing a Sunday which is Easter as no other Sundays in a year are ever Easter. Thats 2 different perspectives to consider it from.

4428185_0	Although the contagious nature of yawning is well established, we know less about why this is so. Researchers are currently giving the topic some serious attention. One theory suggests it's a holdover from a period in evolutionary history when yawning served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. A recent study postulates that contagious yawning could be part of the "neural network involved in empathy."

That's really not cool. People of all races, nationalities, backgrounds pre judge. EVERYBODY does it sometimes (though not necessarily about race).
42750_4	Jesus said that you must be born again in order to enter the Kingdom of God (JOHN 3:3-5). Jesus specified "of the water and of the spirit." When he gave the Great Commission, he specified that one must believe and be baptized to be saved (MARK 16:15,16) and that one must be baptized in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost (MATTHEW 28:18-20). When one is baptized, one is baptized into Christ's death, simulating his death and burial, and then raised up to walk in newness of life, simulating his resurrection (ROMANS 6:3,4; COLOSSIANS 2:12). The Bible tells us that we put on Christ in baptism (GALATIANS 3:27), while ACTS 2:38 tells to be baptized for the remission (forgiveness) of our sins. Being "born again" doesn't refer to the physical rebirth, but the spiritual rebirth, and doesn't refer to reincarnation. God will not allow sin in his presence, so we must be washed clean by the blood of Jesus, only accessible through water baptism, not through the "Sinner's Prayer" or anything else not specified in the Word of God.
42750_5	Jesus [...] said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. (John 3:3)
42750_13	The bible also agrees that there are religions with man made rules. . . In Matthew 15:8 - 9 Jesus says "This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me. But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men".. . Regarding being born again,  no one "needs" to be born again - unless you want to see the kingdom of God, unless you want to be saved. Then - you do need to be born again, according to scripture. Jesus says "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God". . If you receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you will be saved, and born again. Let Him into your heart, He loves you.. . God bless you
42750_25	Born from above, not again. Check out this word "again" in the Greek. Plus what Christ said in John 3:. . Joh 3:3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. . Joh 3:4  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? . Joh 3:5  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. . Joh 3:6  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. . . We all are born of flesh and water, the womb. . That which is born of the Spirit is spirit passing from death unto life.

3288199_0	This is the only real way to instantly cure the hiccups! Look no further! The Hughes/Green method cure's the hiccups EVERY time GUARANTEED! You will be amazed! Hundreds of instantly cured hiccuper's have sent in their testimony's of deliverance! Files are available for researchers! Carefully understand both the HOW and the WHY of this method. If you don't get the WHY you might not get the HOW. Here's how to cure the hiccups:. . "Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure"© 1997. . (1) Pour a TALL glass of water.. . (2) Hold your breath... ***. . (3) IMPORTANT...PINCH YOUR NOSE CLOSED.. . (4) Slowly, take 10 - 20 swallows of the water...while holding your breath with your nose pinched closed.. . (5) When you can't stand it any more....you'll know by that overwhelming drowning sensation -- after a gasp, take a deep breath and relax.. . This cures the hiccups 99 percent of the time - guaranteed! It's a proven medical remedy! (A second treatment could be necessary for stubborn cases.). . *** For stubborn cases, try EXHALING COMPLETELY and then taking 10 - 20 swallows.. . NOW: HERE'S WHY IT WORKS: Hiccups are caused by an uncontrollable spasm in the diaphragm, (the "breathing" muscle). Often, this spasm is triggered by irritable conditions in the smooth muscles of the stomach or the esophagus. The "Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure" forces an increase in the carbon dioxide levels in the diaphragm itself, as well as in the stomach and esophagus. By swallowing, you are making the muscles work -- so they use up their available oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide. By temporarily discontinuing to breath, you prohibit new oxygen from entering your body and thus create an anaerobic condition in the spasming diaphragm muscle. When the spasming diaphragm and stomach are deprived temporarily of oxygen and encounter the higher levels of carbon dioxide ... you feel that scary drowning sensation! BUT this causes the spasming muscles to relax! The hiccups go away! Essentially, you are "tricking" your body into thinking that it's drowning ... and it decides to use it's resources for something other than hiccuping. The rather "scary" drowning sensation caused by this method is NECESSARY for the method to work. If it's not just a little bit difficult ... it doesn't work.

774771_0	one that is constantly mutating, such that its protein coat is always slightly different and so the body's immune system is unable to recognize it quickly as a pathogen to get rid of it.. . also, superviruses may attack the immune system, as in HIV, such that the immune system breaks down.. . in the case of flu, there are thousands of different flu viruses with their unique protein coats. hence the immune system may not have encountered the virus before and is thus slow in recognizing the pathogen
1582877_0	You would be surprised how much of it you use, and which parts of it you use.  As others have said, it's not so much what you learn, but that you learn how to think well and how to learn.    If you are questioning school, I suggest you take a look at the book "The Teenager's Guide to the Real World" - it is very enlightening about school and lots of other stuff that may seem stupid or silly to you right now, but will become invaluable to you as you grow older (see link below...)
1582877_1	The most important thing  we learn in school is 'how to learn'. This is what we use when we are out there in life, on the job, on the street, in our home. After that, it depends on what we want to do with our lives.
1582877_2	Our schools are primarily just socialized babysitting.
1582877_3	School helps prepare us for the real world. Sad thing is, most people don't realize this or care. They mispell words, write choppy english, etc... Then when they get older, they can't organize things, figure their checkbooks, etc... They have no concept of history, and may believe strange things, like some people that don't believe in the Holocaust.
1582877_4	Trust me I thought the same thing in school.  You will use a lot of it in the real world!  Social skills, math, science, history etc...  You will be able to understand the real world better if you go to school even if you don't think you're learning much now!  I realized this recently being a mom and wife now.  I have to deal with the real world(social skills), pay bills(math), understand what's going on in the world (history), be a mom (social skills, science, health),And all kinds of stuff come into play from what you learned in school!  School may also help you decide who you want to become later in life, just go through it and finish it, it will pay off later even if you don't go to college, High School is something everyone should finish!
1582877_5	School is not just for practical learning, such as adding 2+2.  Learning about history, language, arts, abstract mathmatics, etc, makes people more intellegent, more decisive, and more succeful in life.  When you learn about something, you may not use it in real life, but it will certainly open your eyes to something new, therefore making you more aware of the world you live in giving you a greater ability to make judgements in your own life and career because you have a heighten sense of awarness.. . Someone who has gone to only ninth grade as opposed to someone who has gotten their associates degree have vastly different views of the world.  The person with more education is more aware and can make judgement about life in general with a more aware state of mind then the person without it.. . That is why education institutions teach things that we don't use everyday.  We really do use those things, just not practically.
1582877_6	Hmm, i disagree. i think we use Lots of it. Execpt for that algebra class, which im still waiting to see when it will come in handy.
1582877_7	What real world do you live in?
1582877_8	BECAUSE SOMEONE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SAYS WE HAVE TO
1582877_9	TO GET YOU LITTLE BRATS OUT OF THE HOUSE SO MOMMY AND DADDY CAN HAVE SOME QUIET TIME .NOW GET BACK TO SCHOOL DADDY NEEDS A CUDDLE WITH MOMMY
1582877_10	So you are not ignorant!. .      Although you may not use all of it and maybe even forget most of what you learn in school, you will use some when you work.. .      Construction you must have a basic understanding of math and to get better pay you have to be able to read and have a good understanding of numbers.. .      A physician has to have basic knowledge about other countries so she/he can diagnose his/her patient if the patient had come in contact with some type of disease. Once again math (for prescriptions dosage related to weight and so forth) science, and English are crucial.. .      People that work in fast food also need to understand basic language and math skills.. .      Also by going to school we achieve social skills, very important to everyone.. .      Go as far as you can because what you may want to do now may not be what you want to do in the future.
1582877_11	"They" say we go to school to get a "balanced" education, and to learn to interact socially with our peers.  No, we don't need algebra to work at Walmart--we do not need to be able to identify works of art to work at McDonalds--we do not need history to work construction.  . . Apparently, "they" hope that we will learn something that will interest us enough to pursue in life.
1582877_12	You use all of it.. . What you gain from classes like literature and math is a WAY of thinking and problem-solving, which will help you avoid lots of difficulties later. You may not use the obvious content (e.g. graphing the area under a sine curve), but you will be using the problem-solving logic to reason through faster solutions to every day problems.. . Most people, however, when they are in the middle of using those skills, directly link their ability to reason with the exercises they did in their childhood academic classes.
1582877_13	a lot of thing you learn in school is to open your mind and to teach your mind to problem solve and that is very imporant (ie math and sciences)...also some of the stuff (ie history) is so you know what happen in the past so you can learn for other peoples mistakes...you also need to know how to speak problerly and expand you mind to all of the wonderful thing that are in books (ie english)...that is why you need the basic the other thing most schools call electives are just so you can maybe learn what you want to do for aliveing if you are not going to a college.
1582877_14	Most of what we learn is school is used in the real world.. School allows you to find out what you're good at, what you like doing, what you don't.. You learn to socialize and relate to others.. It is very useful, especially if u want to go to college.. . Now, if ur goals in life are sitting on a couch and watching tv, yeah  school is pointless.
1582877_15	School teaches you how to think and you definitely need to be able to think in the real world
1582877_16	because in school you learn the basics that you use for the rest of your life.
1582877_17	You use alot of the knowledge learned in school about how to manage your time, deal with others in society, etc.
1582877_18	So you can learn to use the language correctly.
1582877_19	you just have to know it and if you have kids teach them what you learned
858484_0	To my knowledge it is someone that either only offers one carrier, such as Allstate, or State Farm. Or it may be someone that only offers one line of insurance, such as auto, home, or life insurance.
895703_6	That's actually a pretty simple question to answer. It's amazing how many people think that if they accept Christ into their life, that God - through osmosis or something - gives them EVERYTHING they need to know about how to live their life.  A good percentage of people out there have extremely shallow relationships with God - and they don't know it.. . Christianity is about relationship with Christ. That relationship takes time to develop, and it won't develop just by going to church on sunday only - and CEO Christians (Christmas and Easter only) are the WORST!. . But, they have been accepted by God, and that, you must respect.
2591130_4	This is the system of political thought attributed to the governments of Margaret Thatcher, British Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990.
2182052_0	It all depends on the concentrate to water ratio, no place will do this the same. Also it depends on the water, softer water will taste sweeter where as hard water makes it almost salty
2182052_1	maybe its homemade and dont know how to make it
2182052_2	Because they probably make their own over ice, and no one's bothered to taste it to make sure it's good, and they are not  using Minute Maid from the Coke company.. . Try this for awesome lemonade:. . 2 cups sugar. 2 cups lemon juice (bottled or fresh). . Combine the above in a gallon pitcher, then add enough water to reach the 1 gallon level.  Stir well and serve over ice.
2182052_3	there is no set, official, recipe for lemonade. so lemonade from different restaurants will taste different. Just like your grandmother's cookies vs. toll house, you get the idea.
2182052_4	Because they make it differently, sometimes with too much water, or sugar or too much lemonades even
2182052_5	hi i like the name frank. but not my real name, 2 points for me!
365863_2	Drive-up ATM buttons are marked with braille ... one of those absurd points of principle, but ATM manufacturers say a fair number of blind people do take cabs to drive-up ATMs ...

157907_7	its not the chocolate, its the sugar in the chocolate. sugar will make people get hyper, go mad, and have tantrums. sugar is very unhealthy.
157907_16	Sugar has strange effects on people.  Also, chocolate is caffeinated, so the combination of caffiene and sugar makes some kids, and adults act strangely.
282840_21	punish him everytime he digs
4302021_2	The heat makes the molecules go faster, so it probably the cause of the solubility increase.. . Heat is nothing more than molecules speeding up. We call these molecules heat molecules. If the molecules slow down, stuff gets colder. That's why scientists can make the temperature one millionth of a Kelvin (a temperature scale) away from Absolute Zero. At absolute zero, nothing moves. No movement. Nothing.. . This is why when molecules heat up, it becomes faster because there is more energy. If molecules went fast enough, something might just burn. This is how we have the sun and fire and heat. . . Anyway, I hope this helps!
1205879_1	Because all ATM's are made in the same factory, and they all have braile keypads, regardless of where they are intended to be installed.  It's just cheaper to make them that way.
1956758_0	Because the Olestra caused gastrointestinal problems and diarehha - somewhat like the effects of maltitol, a substance used in certain foods to create a taste of sweetness.  It also causes the same effects.

3816155_11	Not a Bra, but a Bro!!
3681542_9	Easter is always the first Sunday after the first full moon after the 21th of March.. . In this years case, we had a full moon on March 14th and then again on April 13th. . So, the first full moon after the 21th of march was April 13th, and the sunday after that is the 16th of April. . This is ALWAYS how easter is determined, and no you aren't stupid, even most catholics who swear by this holiday actually believe the pope determines this date.  But this is how it is really set.. . . It is NOT always in april, it can be in March as well if the full moon comes at the end of the month.
2757296_3	I honestly believe he did it as retribution against Saddam for attacking George the elder.. . There is no real way to prove that, but GW did say, in advance of the 9/11 events and (obviously) before determining Iraq was "a threat" subsequent to that, he intended to take out Hussein.  It's logical to assume, then, GW invaded Iraq to take out Hussein prior to questions regarding WMDs and possible assistance to terrorist organizations.. . With regard to real economic reasons the US is in Iraq and may go to war with Iran, those are in the realm of unprovable as well at this point in time.  It's obvious we are currently outspending any current fiscal bonuses to be found there.  However, to make it sweeter for our President who is an oil man, if the US has control of the vast oil reserves, GW and his associates will be very, very big players in the world oil alliance if the US is in power in Iraq and Iran.
2757296_10	It was the inadequate intelligence gathering of the U.S.Secret Service and the presumed ownership of weapons of Mass Destruction that MADE this ILLEGAL WAR take place.This PRICE for DEMOCRACY is VERY inconsequential to the LIVES that were lost and will continue to be lost THEIR in IRAQ.
1681233_4	You should wash your face daily. Also the oils in your hair get on your pillow at nite and cause pimples and marks. Coca-butter and shea butter gets rid of the marks on your face. Witch hazel is another product its like rubbing Alcohol. it clears up pimples. clean and clear skin solutions.
4182358_6	Sunlight contains all the visible waveband colors and so appears white, altho it does shine strongly in the 565nm - 590nm wavelength, making it look a little "yellowish". When it is near the horizon (sunrise and sunset), and when it shines through haze, it is distinctly yellow due to atmospheric absorption and diffraction.. . Spectrally, the Sun is a G2 star.
3444414_20	Cause people are dumb, they even ask these questions online
484790_1	I searched Feb 29th and there is no mention of "dame fortune" nor can I find anything on the internet with this name connected to Feb 29th.. sorry
4316220_5	It sounds like you need to find a more convenient time to study. Studying when you're tired is useless--you're not going to be able to comprehend the material or focus. . . Also...are you bored with what you're supposed to be studying? At least in my experience, when I have to study something that doesn't interest me, I have a tendency to get a little "tired." If that's true for you too, then you should find alternative ways of studying instead of reading your textbooks. See if you're book is offered on a CD for the computer--most textbooks are, and they usually include interactive activities and tests. Studying on the computer might help keep you from getting tired when you study.
2167782_0	right lane is called the slow lane, because of the ON RAMP AND OFF RAMP of the freeways.  cars that are coming from a on ramp has to match the speed of the freeway cars.. If the right lane is the fast lane.. the car that are coming from a on ramp has to be really going, cars that have alot of speed might hit the car that is coming from the on ramp.  The faster the car, less reaction time.

1874881_7	our mobile phone is called a "cell" phone coz, the system used for mobile communication-- GSM works on an architecture called cellular architecture.so "cell" word came from a part of this system called a cell.....
2925174_1	The prices are really sickening. Gas prices per gallon should be about $10 per gallon to actually match the value of what gasoline is worth with the other fluids in our life. We use gasoline as though it was free. At the prices we pay for gasoline, it's significantly less than what many people pay for water.. . Putting everything in perspective. Ever notice how much you spend at the grocery store?. . How much do you spend for a gallon of milk. I'd say at least $3/gallon.. How much do you spend on a gallon of cooking oil? Most likely around $6/gallon.. Orange juice? $4/gallon. Soda (generic)? $2/gallon.. Gatorade? $4.78/gallon. . Why is gasoline soo cheap.
2501699_1	Some gases in the air are better conductors of heat than others. One of the best conductors is Carbon Dioxide CO2. However, it is only present in small amounts in the atmospher <1%. . . A significant amount of heat energy that hits the earth from the sun is radiated back into space. On of the things that affect the amount of heat that is radiated back into space is the composition of that atmospher. Because CO2 is such a good condductor of heat, any increase in the amount in the atmospher traps some of the heat that would have been radiated into space, and increasing the temperature of the planet.. . A long time ago the earth was hot because the atmoshpere had great amounts of CO2. Mother nature slowly found a way to trap that CO2 in the form of fossil fuels deep with in the earth. Today, we burn that fuel and re-release that CO2 back into the atmospher, and cause global warmimg.

1373069_0	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can say anything you want as long as it doesn't cause the harm of others. You can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, but you can speak out against you government or any other group. The problem is that people don't limit their actions to speech. Furthermore, our country is a lot better then pretty much any other and all you people who want to complain so much, just leave and you'll find out what it's like to be oppressed.
1373069_1	you should not be aloud to incite violence
1373069_2	I agree, some people don't understand how to use it. People have to realize that everyone has their own opinion, and we are all entitled to it. It's when people start fighting over their answer, or their view, becuz they think they are right. I live in a town in Wisconsin, and just recently a lady was killed by having her throat slit for writing an article in the paper about an opinion she had towards something. We have freedom of speech, but even i get scared sometimes to talk about things, because people just take things that you say way tooo serious!!!
1373069_3	I don't think there should really be a limit unless the person is going over the line which is calling or accusing someone of something with nothing to back it up except your own opinion.
1373069_4	I think if you want to practice law or act like you know it you should enroll in a law school and get on with it instead of harping on this board
1373069_5	I partially agree with you but I disagree when it is difficult and cost hundredrs of dollars for certain groups to obtain permission to gather and protest or people are required to register and provide copies of everyones drivers license that attend your rally for social justice while other groups that no one I know gives a damn about and I certainly don't support like the ku klux klan can march down the freakin street with police protection or those wacko westboro christian hatemongers exercising their free rights by protesting at funerals without exposing them selves to the same risks of police brutality or negative stigmas and media attention that political dissentors recieve and that's another way that frredom of speech is being abused against innocent citizens dissentor has an evil connotation and is only used in mainstream media to describe political progressive individuals and terrorists responsibility needs to be taken by opposing sides of an issue not just by one group or another
1373069_6	A fake term. If it exists -- I would like to see a reporter ask the president of the United State face to face -- "Why can United States have 95% of world's nuclear bomb and Iran or N Korea can't have one. US is the ONLY country who has used it in the past." word for word.

1373069_8	I think it comes down to using discretion, which seems to be an abstract concept for MOST people...in other words...if you want to be sexually explicit, do this when you are sure you are in the company of people who are adult and not going to take offense (like your grand-aunt). If you want to talk racist remarks...go to an Aryan rally where it will be appreciated. We need to understand that we live in a very diverse world and not all things are appropriate at all times.

4198659_0	This is especially applicable to northern states where snow plows spread salt on the highways to prevent dangerous buildup of ice. A significant portion of the salt that is spread ends up on the side of the road. Too much salt is bad for the roadside vegetation and can permanently damage the soil.

2803617_3	As a former "tardy" student I would simply tell them; if they do not wish to receive a bad grade and not graduate then be tardy all they want. Showing up late does not make it in the real world, and you are preparing them for the real world. Make absentee's and tardy's part of their grade. Don't forget to tell them that their potential employers will be calling for a reference.
502532_13	I believe the reason their arguments don't make sense to hard working American capitalists are because we are thinking in an entirely different way.  Ultimately liberal ideology is based on socialist dogma, which simply isn't compatible.. . The next time you are trying to reason with a liberal, understand that whatever issue you are debating isn't actually the issue, instead focus on why capitalism and a free market society are better than a socialist one!  You'll quickly find that they defend the socialist doctrine, even if they won't admit to being socialist.  Wealth redistribution, larger and more powerful government, and ultimately a ruling class are part of a socialist plan.  Let others who know better make your decisions for you!

474417_4	Cyclo comes from "Cyclops" in Greek mythology.
474417_5	The English prefix "cyclo-" comes from the Greek "kyklo-" which basically means "circle, ring, round."  Thus, "Cyclops (Kyklops)" just means "Round eye."

God shows no favouritism to whom He chooses - He saves whom He wills - whether 'catholic' 'protestant', black, white,  fat, thin etc!. . Romans 2:. 11 For there is no partiality with God.. 12 For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law. .  There are many differences of dogma between catholics and protestants but if any are born again - they all have one thing in common - they are united in Christ and are no longer bound by those divisive man made terms!. .

They often howl to signify territorial boundaries, locate other pack members, or attract other wolves for mating. Dogs typically howl at sirens because it is a form of stimulation. . . I live by a couple of firestations and my dog does the same thing. I think it's cute because she tries to mimick the sound of the sirens. :o)

3427520_1	According to webmd.com: . . "What Is Rheumatic Fever? . . A rare but potentially life-threatening disease, rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat, caused by bacteria called Group A Streptococcus. The main symptoms -- fever, muscle aches, swollen and painful joints, and in some cases, a red, lattice-like rash -- typically begin one to six weeks after a bout of strep, although in some cases the infection may have been too mild to have been recognized.". . AND. . "CAUTION! Monitor That Sore Throat.  . Pay attention to sore throats, especially in children. If your child has a severe sore throat without other cold symptoms, accompanied by a fever higher than 101° F, or a milder sore throat that persists for more than two or three days, see a doctor.  It may be strep throat, which should be treated with antibiotics."
4303090_0	It has to do with the alignment of charge due to unidirectional striking force- The same thing will happen to any iron bar after a hard strike-the force generated causes (usually temporary) alignment of enough atoms to generate magnetism. In a normal bar of iron, the atoms are aligned more or less at random, so there is no cumulative directional magnetic force- Any time a significantly large proportion of atoms are aligned together, the summation of the electromagnetic charges can be detected.  Rotating a piece of metal will not induce magnetic charge.  Exposing iron to an extremely powerful magnetic field will, because it will cause alignment of the atoms in the iron, but the magnetic field of the Earth (inside, outside, everywhere) is extremely weak.
1142597_4	I work for a retailer that truly takes pride in customer service and training its associates. This is what makes us stand out in comparison to the competition. Our motto is "Never Say No". We are compensated well for what we do and thats what makes the difference. If you pay $5.15/hr. thats the level of service you should expect. If you're an associate making $16.00/hr. its a hell of a lot easier to smile and say "Hi"! Lastly, all employers preach customer service but in order to make the books look good to investors, they cut back on payroll. This causes a lot of stress on that one associate being pulled in 10 different directions. Of course as the day wears on, he's not going to be the most pleasent person to deal with. Anyway, go shop at a Bed, Bath, and Beyond and tell me what you think about the service you get?

So chill sexy as long as U are not short and chuby .UR cool.
960061_5	Depends on how old you are now. If you are still going through puberty you might still be able to grow taller. However height has got something to do with genes, so people who play a lot of basketball may not be tall, while people who run around playing football might be too tall for their comfort. If you are really desperate to grow tall, there are people doing operations to lengthen the bones in their legs. However this is certainly not encouraged and I would advise you to be happy with your height. Be proud of how you look!
960061_7	if u are under 24, u still have hope to get taller, u can get taller from 18 to 24 by 3, 4 or 5 cm

4075943_3	ok, wow...where do i start...what does the war on Afghanistan have to do with it? Whenever 9/11 happened it was justified by MANY Muslim countries to go into Afghanistan, guess they wanted to eliminate their own religion. No, as no one wants to eliminate all of the Muslims.. . On the war on Iraq, yes this clearly proves what? I don't particularly agree with this war, however, this being said their is no mass killings of Muslims. If im not mistaken its the insurgency that is trying to cause sectarian violence against their own people. Its extremest that want you to believe this crap about all western countries want to destroy all the Muslims which is a horrible lie, that you somehow believe. . . As for the part about the Western world wanting Muslim blood. Believe it or not its a lie. Just get over yourself and stop blammoing all of the western world for everything thing that goes wrong. The US hasn't went and executed millions of people like Husein did, and we won't.. . This one I love the most, about the Israelis  controlling all of the US. I mean I don't see how we covered it up for so long. If you honestly think this was the case don't you think we would've unsupported other Muslim countries?

Many teachers are very willing to spend a little extra time to explain problems or weak areas.  Teachers or your guidance counselor may be able to get another student to tutor you.. . My sister would study very hard but panic for the test.  She always expected low marks but always managed to get her answers respectifully correct.  Even her "best guesses" were often right.. . You will never get high marks unless you work for them.

2380990_16	I think it was a natural kind of biological thing! We evolve, we grow and learn, hopefully have the right kind of environment that fosters a happy well-rounded individual. Sadly, most of the time, it only happens in the books. We live because we were born, our lifes are based on choices made when we were young and immature. If we didn't have good guidance, or if we were too rebellious to listen, then we suffer and we decide ourselves why we live. You are the only one who can say why you continue to live. No one can tell you the answer to a question that mankind has been asking since we were able to ask? I quess we live, to fulfill our destiny...which is of our own choosing. Did that make any sense at all?

255879_8	They keep repeating lies because that's all they have. If a lie is repeated often enough, people start to believe it. Both sides of the aisle lie equally well. I never heard a democrat say Saddam was responsible for 9/11, though. Bob Woodward, in "Bush at War" says "Iraq, along with Al Qaeda, was most probably involved in the September 11 attacks, and President Bush understands that. Already on September 17, six days later, Mr. Bush affirmed, "I believe Iraq was involved, but I'm not going to strike them now." Scott McClellan, right before the Iraq invasion, said " "Listen, we're going to war because President Bush believes Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11. Al Qaeda is a front for Iraqi intelligence."  . . . I agree with your point. Iraqis didn't attack us until we attacked them. Don't sovereign nations have the right to defend themselves? If we had put as much effort into Afghanistan as we are putting into Iraq, bin Laden, who actually DID attack us, never would have made it out of Tora Bora.
255879_11	Why do liberals persist in claiming that Bush lied?. . Since the end of hostilities in the 1991 Gulf War (ie, the one that started with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait), Saddam repeatedly violated the terms of the cease fire.  He routinely fired Surface to Air missiles on allied aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones (established to halt his crackdown on opposition Shiites).  I don't think you will find many conservatives alleging that Iraq attacked us on 9-11, but Iraq's continuing violation of the cease fire terms and failure to abide by UN resolutions led to the war.  In addition, Iraq harbored terrorists escaping from the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, paid "commissions" to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel, and met with terrorist organizations including al-quaeda on numerous occasions before we invaded Iraq.

945249_1	For some reason Thomas is not present at and earlier Sunday evening meeting. So during the days that follow, the others joyfully tell him: “We have seen the Lord!”. . “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails,” Thomas protests, “and stick my finger into the print of the nails and stick my hand into his side, I will certainly not believe.”. . . . Well, eight days later the disciples are again meeting indoors. This time Thomas is with them. Although the doors are locked, Jesus once more stands in their midst and says: “May you have peace.” Then, turning to Thomas, he invites: “Put your finger here, and see my hands, and take your hand and stick it into my side, and stop being unbelieving.”

The APR discloses the real cost of borrowing by adding on the points and by factoring in the assumption that the points will be paid off incrementally over the term of the loan. The APR is usually about 0.5 percent higher than the note rate

1821193_5	this world has gotten really materialistic. I agree with f912guy too lol on his answer
1821193_6	sugar is not a poison... your question is ridiculous . if you had mentioned aspartame or a similar substances this question would of warranted a proper reply
1821193_7	whoa, that's a deep question!. I think the sugar thing is the hypocritical media's selling power (you see ads for chocolate and junk food everywhere, but you also see the message that happiness is being thin as a rail and that it's fashionable to starve to death) giving kids candy for Easter is just what is programmed into our minds by the media, it's not about Jesus rising from the dead, it's about the identity crisis bunny at Cadburys. (I could never figure out why it clucked). . Why there's no chocolate Jesus? Perhaps people might think it's sacrilegious to eat an image of Jesus, perhaps a better to have chocolate crosses since we have crosses printed on church wafers and mints(honest, I once saw them in a bible store, they're called "testamints" it was funny!) sacrilege or not, I think it would be weird eating a chocolate version of any human...yes...even chocolate Santas freak me out
1821193_8	Awwwwww...how mean would that be...Eating Jesus.....pfft
1821193_9	um they want to make there kids fat like america kids r these day FAT!!! but to tell  u the truth i have no idea y ppl do that
1821193_10	There ARE chocolate crosses! :)
1821193_11	would you feel right biting the head off of jesus?
1821193_12	I don't think a little sugar hurts anyone.  As to the chocolate Jesus.  How would we eat the ears first?
1821193_13	because peop´le dont always do what is best for them,. and because some may considder it in bad taste to eat Jesus
1821193_14	lighten up buddy.aren't you glad your mom gave you a choc. bunny?a little education is killing you. things in moderation is ok.. no choc.jesus please. religious icons are to be revered  and respected.we eat the body of christ through eating the host in church.i love choc.and jesus but not together in one piece.
1821193_15	good question. I think the answer is that Christian celebrations have been commercialized to the point that most people celebrating Easter-and Christmas for that matter-are not Christian. The have adopted the holiday and replaced Jesus with Santa Claus and the Easter bunny.
1821193_16	How Can we eat it and not let are children. I NEED CHOCOLATE. No Chocolate Jesus But Are local Fred Meyer Was selling Chocolate crosses For Easter And that just Makes more sense then eating Jesus

Your glasses should get a UV transmission rate of less than 5% to be considered "UV Blocked".

2369927_0	Today it is just  a fun tradition to color Easter Eggs  - historically:. . Intricate Easter egg designs date back centuries. The decoration of Easter eggs to further enhance their value became an art form centuries ago and continues today. Dyes made from vegetables, edible flowers, fruits, coffee, tea, leaves, bark, and roots were used to tint the eggs. Lovely designs were created by wrapping the eggs in ferns before tinting. The art progressed, with western Europeans becoming expert at creating intricate patterns in vibrant colors on the small eggs. . . Here are explanations of some of the many types of decorated eggs: . . • Etched: Traced back to Macedonia, this process involves dying the egg, applying a layer of wax in a design, then bleaching off the color leaving only the wax-covered areas with color.. . • Krashanky: The Ukrainian word means color, and these eggs are dyed a solid, brilliant color, often red to symbolize the blood shed by Christ on the cross.. . • Fabergé: Probably some of the most famous and most expensive Easter eggs known are those created by Russian jeweler Peter Carl Fabergé in the 1800's. The eggs were made of gold, silver and jewels and most opened up to reveal exquisite tiny figures of people, animals, plants or buildings. A total of 57 eggs were made. These are obviously museum artifacts of high value.. . • Jeweled: Designs are created by gluing any manner of sequins, beads, flowers, etc., onto blown eggs.. . • Cut-Out or Carved: Blown eggs are used also for these creations where a portion of the shell is cut away. The exterior is decorated, and the inside filled with a little scene to be viewed through the cut-out section. These can be exquisitely elaborate.

Success in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.. . I am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don't want you to know about.. . Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a two steps process and in order to lose body fat you need to:. . 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 3.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 4.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. 5.Drink plenty of water. . . How does your body burn the fat? . . If you started exercising and then reached a plateau, you have probably burned more muscle tissue than fat with your workout. This is the worst thing that could happen.. . Let me explain. . . Less Muscle = slower metabolism = Weight loss plateau. Then you end up in the yo-yo dieting bandwagon.. . How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . Your muscle tissue is your best friend when it comes to burn body fat. You need to preserve muscle tissues in order to keep losing weight. Most people go on a starvation diet combined a lot of cardio to lose weight. At first it may seems like this is working because they are losing scale weight. . . Now think about, scale weight does not tell you if weight loss is from fat, water or muscle tissue. Scale weight by itself is not a good indicator of success.. . To maintain muscle tissues you need to:. 1.Do some resistance training. (This is not optional, it is mandatory). . . The secret. . Now that you understand the whole fat burning process, I am going to reveal to you how celebrity personal trainers do to get those amazing transformations. The strategy is to combine all the steps that I outlined so the body works as a unit.  First, the trainer makes sure that his client is eating the proper food on a regular basis. . . By that, I mean eating so that fat WILL be released from the fat cells. Then and only then they exercise the body to burn the fat. The important idea to take from this is:. . "The fat can ONLY be burned after it is released from the fat cells".. . If you know anybody that has been exercising like a maniac and they don't seem to go anywhere, now you know why.. . The reverse is also true, do you know somebody that is eating properly but they are not including any resistance training combined with moderate cardio. Now you know why their body still looks the same.. . All you need to do is to combine a nutrition program, along with some MODERATE cardio program and maintain muscle mass with resistance training. Everything is combined with one goal in mind: Turning your body into an Automatic fat burning machine. It is that easy.. . There is a fina

1262692_0	you should go see a doctor, preferably a dermatologist.. they usually prescribe you antibiotic medicine (both in tablet and lotion form), which is quite effective.. . also, use body wash and care product that suit your skin type, or ones that can help your skin to regulate oil secretion.. . most importantly, sleep well(don't go sleep later than 11pm), eat good, and keep healthy:D let your body do its own job regulating itself, and your acne problem will soon get better:D

1262692_3	first you have to determine what skin type you have, if it's oily or if it's normal, or if it's dry.. then you can determine what step to take next. if it's a medication need you have or if it's a hygiene issue.. it has to start with skin type first i believe. also make sure that you drink plenty of water on a regular basis. this will help your skin no matter your skin type. once you have detemined your skin type, you can proceed to take the next step in preventing futher breakouts. the ones you already have will heal eventually in time. if it's a quick cure you are looking for, the best is to get some sun...but not too much to cause a sunburn.

583197_4	Good question.. . In dutch countries, the Muslim immigrants comprise better than 90% of all crime. Wherever your able to measure these things substantively, you find Muslims have very high crime but the problem is that Islamic countries are not transparent like western democracies. Basically, there is no accountablity, no reporting to the UN. No way to correct problems based on objective data.. . So, ultimately, I can only look to Dutch countries or historical data and conclude that Muslim comunities are horribly crime ridden. Consider the recent earthquakes in Pakistan. You could watch Muslin looters and criminals on TV. It took a long time to get in hand.. . But I think the crime your referrring to is Islamic war and terror. Almost all armed conflict worldwide is Islamic. Worse still, historically, Muslims have committed the worlds greatest genocides. Just the hindu genocides alone total in the hundreds of milllions, and that was with swords and fire!. . Slavery ofcourse is a great crime and Muslims are BY FAR HISTORIES GREATEST SLAVE TRADERS. BY A LONG SHOT.

It causes us to look at ourselves rather than God and causes us to try to exert ourselves above others because we think we are god.  It offends God because His glory shines out in all the world, and when we solely focus on ourselves it denies him the glory that should be his.

3698636_6	In cat communication it is a form of greeting.  They are saying hello, and acknowledging you place in the "pride".  Rubbing is them marking you as "their own property". If you watch 2 cats they will do that to each other when they meet.
3698636_7	Cats have scent glands on their cheeks and chin. Rubbing their head on you is a marking behavior to say that you belong to them.
3698636_8	Mine do that when they want me to acknowledge that they are looking for attention, petting and love.
3698636_9	Because they want attention or food... If you show a can of food to my cat, he headbutts it... and he does it to my hand in the morning... it's so cute!
3698636_10	The cat has scent glands on its head. By rubbing its head against you it is marking you as its property ;) - actually the head 'scent' is associated with good feeling to a cat and so it is saying I love you in cat ;)

It can be compared to people buying a house or any other major purchase...sometimes just before we "sign" the deal we get second thoughts or feel 'jumpy' exactly the same way the market is behaving at the moment.

32011_5	Because people need to know that they are born into sin, and they are going to hell without choice unless they accept Jesus Christ as their Personal Saviour.  I was going to hell before I got saved, as were any other born-again Christians.  There's no way to sugar-coat what's going to happen to a non-believer when he dies.  Also, the Bible says to spread the Word so that people won't die and spend eternity in hell.  So if a Christian isn't doing that, he is disobeying God.

1539823_2	Since pulling takes more effort than pushing. When pulling, you must exert significant force on the door. When pushing, a lot of times you can use your whole body to push. Therefore, there is more force on your wrists when pulling. If you look at the way your wrists naturally hang when you lift your hand up, you will see that the fingers are set up to pull from the side. By following this natural position, the side pull puts less torque on your wrists and helps alleviate strains (especially when you pull on a locked door which can impart significant force on your wrists).

2188621_3	you really want to know well lets see. TRIAGE, registration, vital signs, IV's , medication administration, council people, patient advocate, insert catheters, draw blood, paper work up the kazooo, call doctors for orders, call other doctors for orders, clean up vomit, feces, hold a dying patients hand, comfort a patient. cry with a patient, hold down a screaming kid getting stitches, Run a code for a patient who is essentially dead, pray to god you get them back, look into the eyes of someone who has just been told the person they love is dead. fight with administration because the ER is packed and the patients just keep coming and there aren;t enough beds or nurses to take care of all the people who keep on coming in.. Fight with other nurses on different floors of the hospital to come get the patient that has been admitted so you can clear a bed and get the next patient in.. Gown up and gear up for the incoming trauma and pray to god EMS was exagerating about the extent of the injuries.. Take verbal abuse from your patients who seem to think you are the waitress on duty, and its your fault they are waiting 3 hrs because they came to the ER because they have a cold and want to know why they are waiting so long.. You are seen in the order of whats wrong with you , not when you get here, The most serious are seen first. THATS WHY ITS AN EMERGENCY ROOM. Fight with the lab you want your results of your tests, fight with cat scan where are your results, fight with xray this patient has been waiting an hour. Work 12 hrs straight I think I may gave gone to the bathroom just before I showed up for work but by this time I am to tired to tell you. I haven;t had a lunch break. . want me to continue?????

250295_1	You can't on an American passport.  The spouse must get a separate passport.  This is done for security reasons.
250295_4	This depends on the country issuing the passport.  U.S. passports do not have an official designation of spouse printed on the passport itself.  Many countries' passports do not designate relatives or other family members.  A passport is usually meant as identification of the passport holder/traveler only.  . . (However, U.S. passports have a space where you can write in an emergency contact, possibly a spouse.). . If your country of citizenship does allow the placement of a spouse on the passport then you should check with the passport-issuing authority.
1862795_0	Lack of pressure on mucles and spines can cause them (the muscles and spines not the astronauts) to deteriorate. Astronauts strap themselves to bike machines and excerize for hours daily when in space to maintain at the same health they'd be if they were on Earth not excercizing at all. If they fail to keep their muscles and bones active, they can experience painful damage to the muscles and even early signs of osteoperosis, the deterioration of bone mass that people on earth experience when they don't have enough calcuim, which can lead to injuring the bone. However, the excercise is easily enough done that maintaining gravity inside spacecraft is not an issue.
1862795_1	Well one effect is that the spine stretches, due to the fact that there is not weight or pressure on the spine.  Most astronauts come back slightly taller, but once on earth for a while they slump back to their normal height.

2804395_3	I think it is part of human nature, to judge someone or something. It is a naturally done and so many people do it without knowing it. Its hard to explain, but I think it is easy to judge things that we do not do ourselves because it is different. People do not like different things, of course not all people. So in judging people different then us, we set ourselves apart from others, allowing us to put other people and their idea's down.

856167_0	they do have a nucleus when they are still being formed in the red bone marrow, but once they are mature enough the nucleus is excluded so that there is maximum room to store-hole hemoglobin in the rbc.  less than 1% of rbcs are found in the cirulation-blood.  If more than that,it is indicative of disease and needs to be treated since rbcs with nucleii can't carry oxygen, are too big,and get squished-damaged in the capillaries.  Without a nucleus they can fit single file and go thru without getting too beat up-bruised and live their usual life of 120 days.

1835309_1	Kallisteia is a greek word that comes from kallos, which means beauty. In modern greek it means a beauty contest. If you are referring to mythology, it could be something to do with Kallisto, who is a nymph or some sort of mythological person.
3806679_3	Light can be thought of as wave.  Different types of light have different size waves.. Atoms and Molecules vibrate in a wave-like fashion.  When the  certain molecules vibrate at the same frequency (speed, size) as a specific type of light, the molecules will absorb that light and either reflect it or release it as heat (usually a combination).  . High energy UV light is bad for your eyes, but visible spectrum light is necessary to see.  Sunglasses are composed of materials that absorb/reflect light in the UV spectrum but allow visible light to pass through to you eyes.  Typically some of the visible light is absorbed as well, which is why the world appears in a different color or is darker.  . . To give an example, purple light is very similar in wavelength to UV light, so it would to be a huge stretch to find that your UV filtering sunglasses also filter purple light.  B/c colors are a mixture of light, all of the colors that you look at would be without purple, which would change their color as you see it.

3055782_12	I never understood why people go to church 3 times a week anyway.  Especially TWICE in one day(Sunday morning/Sunday night).  I really think you could grow more as a christian by spending the time helping others (IE volunteering at a shelter, nursing home, animal rescue, etc.)  I think going to church on Sunday morning only is perfectly fine.  It makes me sick people WASTE their time just sitting their butts on the church pew and not gaining anything out of it.  I bet Alot of people who are "church-a-holics" (as I call them) probably can't even tell what the sermon was about the second they walk out the church doors. What is the point in going 3 times a week if you are "bored" b/c I know you aren't listening when your there. I think churches should as a group on Sunday nights go to an organization where people are in need and help them INSTEAD of having another service and TAKING UP ANOTHER OFFERING.  . AND HERES ANOTHER THOUGHT......... You said your bored....ok....again why go then?  Do you think you are fooling GOD?  While you may be able to fool other people by going to church 3 times a week- you can't fool GOD.  He knows you dont want to be there.  . . You need to find something that will enrich your spirituality and help you grow in the Lord -- and only you will know what that is. Pray and ask the Lord to help you find it.  Good Luck.

3552010_0	It's a parents job, like it or not, to prepare the kids for the world, and how the world will expect the same thing from them that is expected at home.. Manners, curfews, time to work, time out of work, what to say, what not to say, etc.. basically, we would be chewed up and spit out if we were unfamiliar with rules and restrictions, AND, people would blame your parentrs for it, so we are just covering our a$$es
3552010_1	because they have to do something and its a heck of a lot better than hitting or beating them.
3552010_2	Because they are hoping that their child will realize that they are not doing the right thing. But in the restriction they need to teach them that and how to make better choices otherwise the child will just keep doing it
3552010_3	how do we know the child will do the same thing over. Plus it depends on the age of the child. If he/she is a small toddler then grounding does no good. You put them in a time out spot or chair for their appropriate age. If they are old like 10 or older. Then yes grounding them or taking things away will have to be the consequences. The child must learn that for every action there is a reaction. It was his/her choice to behave badly. So it is his/her choice to take the responsibility for his actions.
3552010_4	"When they know the kids will do the same thing?"  I want to try to answer your second question first.  Parents do not KNOW that the child will do the same thing again and they likely HOPE the child will not.  Any form of "restriction" is a form of punishment whereby certain privileges or even rights are taken away.  This is a model of how criminals are treated in our (U.S.) society.  Depending on the infraction, more or less privileges are taken away.  It is obviously not the best deterrent but would you rather that parents torture their children into submission every time they commit an infraction?
3552010_5	Because it makes us feel better, that at least we attempted to stop them from doing whatever it is again.
3552010_6	I think that parents have the Idea that if they punish their kids for the same thing enough that they will get tired of doing it and stop.  The problem with parents today is that they don't talk to their kids enough.  Kids tese days know more at an earlier age thatn we did.  Parents should be open and talk about anything with their kids even if it means hearing something they don't want to.

1203813_21	I'm not sure why people are blaming McDonalds.  When it comes down to it, bad parenting is the reason for child obesity.  . . Children burn more calories than any adult.

Child obesity is the result of parents allowing their kids to become couch potatoes, playing video games and watching movies, instead of outside playing and burning calories.

3496147_1	Hello smurf2001.. :). . For one thing..you were not in His Father's temple..they were selling and buying sacrifice's to the Lord..so Jesus said you have turned my Father's house into a den of thieves... . Second, If and when you obey God, many are sent to prison (Paul) for example, for not denying Christ... . In Jesus Most Precious Name... With Love..In Christ..
3496147_2	You were not punished for being Christlike, you were only punish for breaking the law, Jesus went to the Church and not bank and please stop comparing yourself with Jesus and really when you are punished for being christlike you would be glad u wer punished and u won't announced it.. . Blessed are the ones who are persecuted for Christ sake...
3496147_3	You forgot to get yourself circumcised?
3496147_4	You know you were right and that is what is important... Jesus was persecuted so don't worry your little blue head about it.. . Oh, wait... in a bank? No, Jesus did it in a TEMPLE. At least your heart was in the right place.
3496147_5	ha ha! too bad it didn't really happen, but i'll answer your question anyways.. . jesus was mad because they made a place of worship into a bank and auction yard. he wouldn't get mad at a bank for changing money. but he said that he father's house had been made into a den of theives. he wasn't mad because someone was using the bank!. . also, i don't think he would be swearing. and he had righteous anger, not some crazy anger derived from drinking too much.. . does that help at all?
3496147_6	You've done nothing wrong at all.
3496147_7	You where in the BANK fool not a Holy temple.  I think you got it twisted!
3496147_8	I think you're trying to be funny because I can't stop laughing!  Well you went wrong for many reasons.  First it's against the law to verbally threaten someone so you were acting like a criminal.  Another common sense thing is hello you're at a bank, that should speak for itself.  Anyway good try my friend I hope you find other ways to be like Jesus.  Maybe you should get up on the cross.
3496147_9	Brother I understand your pain.  You tried to follow the example of Jesus in the Bible.  Its just a shame they persecute you.

2390944_1	1. adequate skin hygiene : regular washing,application of an antiseptic agent,effective wiping without causing extensive dryness. 2. regulate or do not alter facial skin pH by using multiple agents, plain soap or combinations (find those cleansing agents that do not irritate or dry ur skin providing u with the sensation of cleaness ) 3. visit the dermatologist so as to determine the quality of the pimple and the intensity (grade and type) of ur acne problem.(u could be asked to use specific rehydrating agents plus antimicrobial agents as acne is due to the obstraction and subsequent inflamation of specific parts of the hair follicle or pores of the skin, usually right above the drainage point of the laterally coexistant sebacuous gland ) common bacterial factors are the propionibacterium, staphyloccoci etc 3. special medication with retinoids or if u are a girl and ur acne problem is big (cystic acne) special medication with contraceptives may be induced 4. after the healing process of ur acne and when u grow at an age tha a future recurrence is minimal, aesthetic measures such as dermabrasion are suggested in case that unwanted spotting or scars have formed

29421_6	I used to have a bunch of warts on my hands as a teen-ager.  I tried everything, even old wives tales and nothing worked.  Then my dentist told me to put castor oil on cotton and place it on the wart with tape or bandaide.  Always keep it on there, keeping the oil on the wart,  replacing it after a bath and so on.  Keep it like that for 7 days and let it dry.  It should fall off with a flick of a fingernail.  Mine sure did.
29421_9	It should turn black in color only if the doctor has frozen it. To know if it is gone it has to fall off (A slight hole will be left in its place) then you no longer will have the wart. I have been told by doctors if you use duck tape to cover; it will kill it. Believe it or not it does work. To get rid of warts it takes up to two to three weeks or longer.
29421_12	If you're able to see it, IT LIVES!  You'd have to continue using the acid until the wart is completely dissolved, and the area of skin around it will continue to be painful while using the acid.  Try the wart freezing method that is currently so popular.  Ask your local pharmacist for help with selection of the product.  It is supposed to have quick results, and easy to use. Good luck to you!  And shame on all the smart-asses with the same tone of answer.

1453706_9	Water was commonly used in automobile radiators as the coolant of choice since the first cars were built. Water cools and heats at a constant rate and that made it reliable as a coolant, plus it was and is readily attainable..   New technology and chemistry started producing other specifically designed coolants to enhance radiator performance and handle extreme hot and freezing temperatures. Thus water is still used but the synthetic coolants are better for radiator and engine life.
1453706_13	Water is used ONLY if the proper coolant is unavailable.  Water does not have the heat transfer rate that radiator coolants do, i.e prestone coolant.  There is also the problem during winter, with water freezing, when these coolants will not.. . If your radiator has only water in it... you can expect some problems during extreme heat, or cold.
4015240_0	Are you from Texas?  We eat that all the time and it's wonderful...Chiken Fried Steak is a round steak, tenderized and seasoned, usually with Salt, Pepper and Garlic Powder.  It's then dipped in a mixture of egg and milk and then floured and then fried...giving it a lovely golden brown "crust" consistent with the look of "Fried Chicken" hence "Chicken Fried Steak".  It's really good.
4015240_2	What they do is take a small steak, coat it with flour, egg and breadcrumbs, and then fry it off. It is presented just like Southern-fried chicken, hence the term "chicken-fried". Admittedly, I used to think it got its name because it was cooked in chicken fat. Such a culinary term is not used in the UK.
4015240_3	It's fried as you would chicken-chicken fried  steak
4015240_4	It's steak that is fried like chicken. That is why it's called chicken fried steak.

3596739_2	There is no SAFE way to lose 20 lbs in 2 weeks.  Your best bet is to take a few months to lose the weight safely.  Or better yet, take 6 months or so to get yourself into better shape.  . Start by jogging 3-5 days a week, for at least 30-45 minutes each outing.  . Combine this with pushups, pullups, and situps 3-5 days a week.

1239284_7	This is called Bernoulli's Principle whic states that- . .  work done=change in kinetic energy,.  change in pressure*area*distance=change in kinetic energy.   .  this implies .  Pressure+(kinetic energy/volume)=Constant. . Hence when speed of medium is high then it have low pressure and any thing will move from high pressure to low pressure.. . The wings of an airplane is made in the way that pressure above them remains low(due to high speed of air above them in comparision to lower side of wings).due to this an upward thrust get exerted on wings which causes plane to fly in the air..    Bernoulli's principle also explains spining of a cricket ball,perfume spraying etc.

4433714_2	Cook the peaches a little first and thicken with corstarch before you put on the crust, also add some peach preserves for extra flavor but cut down on the sugar. Tyr A crumb crust instead of pastry crust. I can't think of anything else. You could let it cool before you cut into it.
4433714_5	My Mom used to mix some flour with the cinnamon and sugar she sprinkled over the apples when making apple pie, if she felt the apples were too juicy, and might make the pie runny.. . Maybe this would work with peaches, too? Mix the sugar, cinnamon, whatever you coat the peaches with, with some flour, toss to coat.. . You could probably use cornstarch, too.. . Hope this helps.  :-))
4278201_0	chloroplast contains pigments for capturing solar energy for photosynthesis.plant cells absorb light of visible spectrum that have wavelength between 400 to 700 nm. and uv radiation doesnt fall between it so plant cannot absorb this part of ligt rays. if a plant will be subjected only to uv rays then the plant will die.
4278201_1	-UV light irradiation initially increases the rate of seed germination but the subsequent growth of the seedlings was markedly retarded.. -UV light inhibited radicle elongation and shoot elongation  but shoot elongation inhibited to a lesser extent than radicle elongation.. -UV light also suppresses root and shoot biomass, leaf area, and leaf number .
4278201_2	Ultraviolet can cause what they call safe mutation if seeds exposed while germination is going on. other light such as infrared is a must for some seed germination e.g. lettuce.

To me you seem like a freshman in the spirituality university. I think you need to aim your questions higher than the kindergartners!! It is what you KNOW in your heart that makes you spiritually mature -- no 'Godly' or religious words necessary!! In your heart, what you KNOW is right is Divine speaking to you. The only question is this: do you act on what you know, or not? . . God is Love.

4347647_4	Not all cats hate the water. Cats that are native to hot areas seem to enjoy the water like lions, jaguars, and tigers. They enjoy taking dips in a stream to cool off! Who wouldn't? However cats that live in colder climates tend to dislike the water like bobcats, cougars, lynx, and snow leopards. Water damages the ability of the cat's fur to insulate the animal against the cold. This explains why cold weather cats don't like the water and hot weather cats do! Some house cats enjoy playing with the a drippy faucet (I know my cat does!) but it all pretty much varies from cat to cat. And it all depends on it's previous experience.

3038038_0	Term used currently in the United States and Canada (and in other countries as well during the 1980s) to refer to most mobile phones. It technically applies specifically to mobile phones which use a cellular network. In developing mobile phone technology, American electrical engineers saw the main technical problem as achieving a smooth handoff from one radio antenna to the next. After they gave the name "cell" to the zone covered by each antenna, it was a natural choice for them to apply the term "cellular" to both the technology and the phones that ran on it.

4482703_2	Lower H2O2 concetration promotes seed germination.30% hydrogen peroxide also is effective as a stimulant of germination. Very dilute hydrogen peroxide also accelerates later growth if used only occasionally.
4482703_3	Changes in catalase (CAT) activity and in CAT isoform pattern and expression were investigated in developing sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds during desiccation on the mother plant and after artificial drying on the flowerheads. Seeds regularly desiccated during their development on the mother plant and reached mass maturity at c. 42 d after flowering (DAF). Freshly harvested seeds did not germinate at any stage of development because they were dormant, but their dormancy was broken after 5–6 months of dry storage. Immature seeds were desiccation-tolerant at 24 DAF since they were able to germinate fully after artificial drying on the flowerheads followed by dry storage. CAT activity increased in non-dehydrated seeds during their development, reaching a maximum a little after seed mass maturity and after artificial drying in immature seeds. This stimulation of CAT activity by natural and artificial drying was related to changes in CAT isoform pattern. Of the four constitutive CAT subunits, that of 59 kDa was always present, but dehydration induced the synthesis of a 55 kDa subunit. This synthesis of the CAT 55 kDa subunit resulted from an activation of the CATA1 gene, suggesting that the regulation of catalase activity and synthesis by drying occurred at the transcriptional level. The increase in CAT activity induced by seed drying was associated with a decrease in hydrogen peroxide level and in lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that CAT plays a role during seed desiccation by preventing dehydration-related oxidative damage and that H2O2 may play a role in the regulation of CAT gene expression and the transduction pathway of the dehydration signal.

When the media reports an attack, would they be doing anyone any good to hold back a bomber's nationality because it may offend you?

3389038_7	Living in the UK, I am lucky that that a lot of our media is prepared to take a broader view on topics. Certainly, there are a lot of examples of the British media taking time out to explore Islamic culture and to try and portray a more accurate view of lifestyle and culture.. . In the sources below, I post a link to a radio documentary broadcast on BBC last weekend which I believe provides an in-depth and objective view on the topic. It's two hours and has some fluffy stuff before the programme, but well worth listening to.. . However, the media will report news. A group of Arabs sitting in a coffee shop discussing philosophy isn't news and won't get reported.. .  Agroup of muslims taking to the streets of London demanding that a cartoonist be executed for drawing some pictures is news. It also runs against the culture of fairness and free speech that is the core of our democracy - so it is certainly going to portray Islam in a bad light.. . The Western culture has a very different way of undertaking protest. It tends to be non-violent and based around debate. Yet whenever we see Islamic protests they seem to involve threats or actual violence, flag burning and intimidation.. . In the case of the London protests, these were not born out of fruistration at not being able to make a point - these were the first instincts of protest.. . You see, Islam and the Arabs have a real image problem in the West. It isn't just a problem with our media not understanding you - it is just as much about you and your media not attempting to understand us.

Faster cars offer better acceleration, response, and overall better driving enjoyment.  A car limited to 75, is just not utilizing the potential of efficient transportation.  It's also marketting and sellability.  As with most things in life, most people like power, better, faster, bigger, super, etc.  Unfortunately, we cannot change peoples behavior, and if you limit it to 75.  Many motorists will find ways to "modify" the cars to go faster.  Imagine a police car running after a criminal at 75 mph...

Considering the stiff tax you're going to end up paying you'd probably be better off borrowing money from somewhere.  Compare the cost of borrowing against the taxes you're going to have to pay.  I'm sure borrowing will be substantially cheaper.  After you start your new job try to designate some portion of your salary to fund an emergency fund.  That fund needs to be equal to 3-6 months of living expenses.

463986_19	you are right and wrong at the same time. I asked a question like this. They are not the same thing though Catholicism is a type of Christianity. Catholics differ from most other Christian faiths greatly though
463986_27	Catholicism is absoulutley not original christianity!  Did Jesus say "pray to my earthly mom"?  Or "heres some beads to pray with"?  How about... "mary is perfect... make rituals... works will save you...  kill anyone who doesnt follow..."?  Catholicism and the bible dont work.  Thats why priests used to tell followers not to read the bible.  Yes Jesus Christ came and died for us all... but he did not die for His people to be what the Catholic church has become.  If you believe that the Catholic Church is the original and right ... then do yourself a favor and actually read your bible.

4153592_6	Does she wash everywhere??... You ever think the smell might not be coming from her ear but somewhere lower
4153592_7	Infection along with a buildup of earwax could be the source or the smell could be due to insufficient hygiene for another part of the body.  If this woman is bathing with soap and water and still smells, she needs to see a doctor to get a diagnosis and resolve the problem.  There are odor neutralizing tablets that could be taken internally for some causes of odor.
4153592_8	it can be an earache or not being cleaned or her hygiene!

4153592_13	A bacterial infection.
4153592_14	Bad smell from ear can only mean infection, but other people shouldn't be able to smell it. My guess that something else is wrong and the ear thing is an excuse. But it is your mum's friend so talk to your mum but don't get involved directly.

3493286_6	VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCY. The key to producing power in an internal combustion engine is volumetric efficiency. An engine can make more power with the same amount of fuel if it can get more air(or specifically oxygen) into the combustion chamber and then vent that gas. Turbochargers and superchargers force more air into the intake of a motor. Some manufacturers these days are favoring the turbocharger because it is "free energy" since it runs off the exhaust gases where as a supercharger usually runs off the serpentine belt in effect making the engine work harder than it would without the supercharger. In the end, car manufacturers have started using more turbochargers these days to get better fuel mileage out of that vehicle and sell more cars to make more money.

2188695_4	The same reason a drop of mercury in a bowl is round. 'Round' is the most stable state. It's the only configuration that gets the most 'earth' closest to the center and uses up the most gravitational potential energy. You can see how this works by imagining an avalanche. The rocks move as close as they can toward the center of the earth by falling and along with erosion, tends to make the earth even more 'rounder'.

Pregnancy tests may be performed to confirm your doubts, however, even some of the pregnancy test kits sold in the drug stores may not be 100% efficient. The OB-Gyne is the best person to approach. Pre-mentrual pain is sometimes confused with the symptoms you mentioned. It is best to seek professional help so that you could avoid things that would affect the development and growth of the fetus if it is true that you are pregnant.
489357_6	Mary I, the queen of England from 1553 to 1558 became known as "Bloody Mary" during the reign of her successor, Elizabeth on account of the perceived ferocity of her religious persecutions; she has borne the epithet ever since. "Bloody Mary" is also a name for a ghost or witch who appears in children's folklore; other very similar tales use different names.. . Several fictional characters are also called Bloody Mary. . In folklore and children's street culture, "Bloody Mary" is the name of a children's game in which a ghost or witch of the same name (or sometimes other names, such as Mary Worth) is said to appear in a mirror when summoned. One of the more common ways participants attempt to make her appear is to stand before a mirror in the dark and repeat her name three times, though there are many variations. Some include chanting a hundred times, chanting at midnight, spinning around, or rubbing one's eyes. Most of these are meant to disorient people. In some versions of the legend, the summoner must say "Bloody Mary, I killed your son!" (or "I killed your baby"). In these variants, Bloody Mary is often believed to be the spirit of a mother (often a widow) who murdered her children, or a woman who was murdered shortly before or after her wedding. In stories where Mary is supposed to have been wrongly accused of killing her children, the querent might say "I believe in Mary Worth." This is similar to another game involving the summoning of The Bell Witch in a mirror at midnight. Similar rituals are also used to summon spirits in the movies Beetlejuice (1988) and Candyman (1992). The game is often a test of courage, as it is said that if Bloody Mary is summoned, she would murder the summoner, often in a quite violent way, such as gouging out his or her eyes. Other variations say that the querent must not look directly at her, but at her image in the mirror; she will then reveal the querent's future, particularly concerning marriage and children.. . Bloody Mary Worth is typically described as a child-murderess who lived in the locality where the legend has taken root about a century ago. There is often a specific local graveyard or tombstone that becomes attached to the legend.. . On the other hand, various people have surmised that the lore about taunting Bloody Mary about her baby may relate her tenuously to folklore about Queen Mary I. ([1], [2]) The queen's life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies. Had Mary I successfully borne a child, this would have established a Roman Catholic succession and threatened the continuance of her religious persecutions after her death. Speculation exists that the miscarriages were deliberately induced. As a result, some retellings of the tale make Bloody Mary the queen driven to madness by the loss of her children. ([3]) It is likely, however, that Queen Mary I provided only her nickname to the Bloody Mary of folklore.. . She is also confused in some tellings of the story with Mary Queen of Scots. Bloody Mary is sometimes said to have bathed in the blood of her child victims in order to retain a youthful complexion; this would appear to confound her with Elizabeth Báthory.. . The mirror ritual by which Bloody Mary is summoned may also relate to a form of divination involving mirrors and darkness that was once performed on Halloween. While as with any sort of folklore the details may vary, this particular tale encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant, of course, that they were destined to die before they married.

491228_0	My shihtsu had a wart on her hind leg 2 weeks ago and we brought her to the vet because she had been chewing at the wart, causing it to be swollen and bloody. the doctor prescribed a cream and bandaged it up in a cool blue bandage, and that broke her habit of chewing it. now the wart is nearly flat and my dog is not disturbed by it anymore.. So the best way to get rid of a wart is to use the vet's prescribed medicine.
491228_4	If your dog is the one with the wart, there is not much you can do at home. The only way to make it go away is by surgically removing it. Don't try to use commercial human wart removers, it can cause serious skin problems with dogs (Ive seen dumb people do it.)

1364894_0	well usually the customer service rep has a background in medicine, I've worked as an assistant to the doctor for years, and usually when I ask patients..i don't say WHY DO YOU WANT THE DOCTOR?..i usually just ask the patients..what are your symptons, so I can write it down in their file and the doctor knows what he's dealing with. Doctor's are so busy, its nice to give them a little help sometimes..they appreciate it.
1364894_1	Well, they need to be able to make a decision about how serious it is. If you broke your nose, you need to be seen soon. If you have a funky wart on you knee, that can wait. They are only trying to help.. . And you don't have to tell them your life story, you know. You can be vauge. Instead of telling them that you've been, say, on your period for a month, you can say you're having a "girly" problem.. . They aren't trying to pry, they are just trying to get you the help you need within a reasonable amount of time.
1364894_2	Just tell the operator their are HEPPA laws that prevent you from discussing any med. reasons from answering these questions. If it's a clinic they basically ask you what are your symptoms are so they can quarintine you from other patients. ( i.e. fever,rash,chills) could be something contagious
1364894_3	The customer service people decide which doctor you need to see. Certain doctors only deal with certain issues. Also the doctor can do some research beforehand to find out what kind of illness you have.. . I think that people who know were they need to go should have direct access to a doctor. Those who are stupid need customer service to guide them to the right doctor.
1364894_4	You have to tell them what kind of symptoms you're having so the doctor will know a little bit about it ahead of time and by telling them ahead of time they'll know better if it's serious or not and if they think it's serious then they can make you're appointment sooner and you can't tell this straight to the doctor or nurse over the phone when you make your appointment because they're too busy to schedule appointments too
1364894_5	It's so they know how much time to schedule for the appointment. If it's a minor illness, they'll schedule you for fewer minutes, and for more complicated cases, they'll schedule more time with the doctor. It's only to lessen the time you spend in the waiting room, not necessarily because they're nosy bastards.
1364894_6	The operator takes down your major symptoms and allots an appointment based on their (ahem!) 'training'. Apparently they can schedule a longer appointment if necessary.. . Also, the idea is that a staff nurse or the doctor will look through the list of patients/appointments at some point and do some minor 'triage'. If anything jumps out then they will call the patient and have them either come in immediately or visit the Emergency Room at a local hospital.. . Personally, I believe that I could describe my symptoms as, "I just sawed my leg off," and my appointment would still be three weeks away!. . But yes, it is kind of 'icky'.... . ME: "Hello... yes... well, my penis is twice it's normal size and it's grown two ears and some hair on it's head.". . CS: "Oh yes, we can fit you in on Tuesday, August 5th 2007. Can you make that time?"
1364894_7	They might need to know, so they can figure out whether you need to see the doctor "right away" or it can wait a few days.. . I don't go into specifics with operators.  Just tell them "think I have a flu", or something like that.
1364894_8	i really agree with you on this issue...the customer service/operator does not know your condition....what i do is brief it so she can schedule me with the CORRECT doctor...she won't remember you anyway...she has 200 plus calls a day..just tell her your symtoms...that should do it...i hope this helps somewhat...
1364894_9	So they can schedule a long enough appointment for your particular ailment. The people who schedule your appointment are professionals and if they blab, they will be fired!!!
1364894_10	They need to know approximately how long your appt will take and how many other people they will be able to schedule in a certain time frame. Basically to maximize their time and their money.
1364894_11	I think they should just make  appointments and let us talk to our doctors about what is wrong.. BUT, I can take this one step further, they also ask if I still have insurance BEFORE they will give me an appointment!! THEY SHOULD NOT BE ASKING THAT!!!!!!!!
3702593_2	Good luck, because they will hide behind 9/11 and new security measures...they will call you "unpatriotic" or a "Potential terrorist" to cover their intrusive, rude, attacks.. . Be glad that places are being that thorough, because maybe those actions will help prevent the next hi-jacking.

971813_1	anxiety vs depression . ...anxiety vs depression. Anxiety Everything about anxiety. Anxiety.... . www.anxietyis.com/depression-and-anxiety-help/anxiety-vs-depression
971813_3	1) Anxiety:  . Anxiety is a complex combination of the feeling of fear, apprehension and worry often accompanied by physical sensations such as palpitations, chest pain and/or shortness of breath. It may exist as a primary brain disorder or may be associated with other medical problems including other psychiatric disorders.. . 2) Depression:. Depression (mood)  . Depression, in everyday language, refers to any downturn in mood, which may be relatively transitory and perhaps due to something trivial. This is differentiated from clinical depression which is marked by symptoms that last two weeks or more and are so severe that they interfere with daily living.. In the field of psychiatry the word depression can also have this meaning but more specifically refers to a mental illness when it has reached a severity and duration to warrant a diagnosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) states that a depressed mood is often reported as being: "... depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps'.". .  Depression (geology)  . Depression in geology is a landform sunken or depressed below the surrounding area. Depressions may be formed by various mechanisms, and may be referred to by a variety of technical terms.. . Depression (economics)  . In economics, a depression is a term commonly used for a sustained downturn in the economy. It is more severe than a recession (which is seen as a normal downturn in the business cycle). Considered a rare but extreme form of recession, the start of a depression is characterised by unusual increases in unemployment, restriction of credit, shrinking output and investment, price deflation or hyperinflation, numerous bankruptcies, reduced amounts of trade and commerce, as well as violent currency devaluations. Unlike a recession, there is no official definition for a depression, even though some have been proposed. Generally it is marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced given current resources and technology (potential output). One could say that while a recession refers to the economy "falling down," a depression is a matter of "not being able to get up." . . Depression (meteorology)  . A depression (also called a 'low') is an area of low pressure caused by rising air.. This is opposite to an anti-cyclone which is an area of high pressure.
971813_5	Anxiety is a kind of looking to the future, seeing dangerous things that might happen in the next hour, day or weeks. Depression is all that with the addition of 'I really don't think I'm going to be able to cope with this, maybe I'll just give up.' It's shutdown marked by mental, cognitive or behavioral slowing.

3778229_0	There wasn't really a method. They looked to see if you had any marks that would be the devils...but most of them were simply accused by the ranting girls or by neighbors who were in debt to the accused or something like that. And, since the court was too stubborn to back down, they simply kept sentencing people...until the girls went too far and accused a high officals daughter.
3778229_1	If she weighs the same as a duck...she is made of wood!! . . And therefore.. a witch!. . Good Luck. . Jimmy
3778229_2	Besides the methods mentioned above, an accused witch was literally bought to trial before the court. The court decided if they were guilty or not based on testimony given.. If a person could not say the Lord's prayer perfectly, they were thought to be possesed by the devil, and thus, a witch.

3778229_5	On of the ways was to throw the suspected witch in a lake or large vat of water.  If she floated, see was a witch.  On the down side, alot of people drowned before someone decided they weren't a witch.. Another way was the woman who was questioned was forced to have sex with the questioner.  The questioner could "feel" if the woman was a witch or in league with the devil.

3078448_0	The dark meat of the chicken retains moistness more so than the breast meat. Try recipes using legs and thighs instead of breast meat.  Also leave the skin on when cooking ( you can always remove it later).  When barbecuing I marinade chicken thighs 4-24 hours ahead of time(throw away the marinade afterwards to avoid food poisoning.
3078448_1	For oven baked chicken, bake as you normally would, but after removing from the oven, cover in foil and let sit 15 mins. All good chefs recommend this to keep the chicken moist.

1745273_0	i will just give you a brief rundown of what prognosis definitions are.-grim=almost no chance of recovery..Critical= means that the next few days or weeks are extremely crucial in making sure that all the right procedures are done at the right times and that the patient is continually monitored and treated...Guarded actually isn't bleak it basically means that the doctors don't know what is going to happen because there are probably thousands of cases just like your dad's that have came out of it just fine and then there were other cases where the patient did not make it. Guarded means less about how they think he is going to do and more their opinion on what is going to happen is guarded. next is fair which basically means the patient should recover fine as long as they follow what the doctor tells them to but there is a small chance of difficulty. finally good condition means that there is no reason as to why the patient shouldn't fully recover.

2351592_1	when you are in prison, you have to follow their rules,. eat your meals when they said and eat what they fix.. you have only one hour a day where you can be outside, the rest you in your cell.. you cannot leave the compound when you want to or go to the store when you want to.. the wardens have the right to read all your mail coming and going out. no privacy.. you have to wear what they want you to wear, usually orange or blue clothes. no belts allowed. . if you get a job while in jail, you get paid like .10 cents per hour. . people can only visit when they say your family and friends can visit. all this does not include prisoners who like to cause a lot of trouble and could put you in lock down, which means all the doors are locked until they feel it is safe to open the cells back up. it seems like i know a little about prisons, it is because i have had friends that have done time and i did 28 days at a city jail in Louisiana. . if you go to jail in Marijo county Arizona, you will have to wear pink boxer shorts for under-ware.. they are not fun at all, but if you stay out of trouble while you are in jail, it will help you get out of jail earlier then your sentence if the state does that.

1376686_1	Have you ever watched someone try to cover up gray hair by dyeing it? Or maybe you wonder why your granddad has a full head of silver hair when in old pictures it used to be dark brown? Getting gray, silver, or white hair is a natural part of growing older, and here's why.. . Each hair on our heads is made up of two parts:. . a shaft - the colored part we see growing out of our heads . a root - the bottom part, which keeps the hair anchored under the scalp. The root of every strand of hair is surrounded by a tube of tissue under the skin that is called the hair follicle (say: fah-lih-kul). Each hair follicle contains a certain number of pigment cells. These pigment cells continuously produce a chemical called melanin (say: meh-luh-nin) that gives the growing shaft of hair its color of brown, blonde, red, and anything in between. . . Melanin is the same stuff that makes our skin's color fair or darker. It also helps determine whether a person will burn or tan in the sun. The dark or light color of someone's hair depends on how much melanin each hair contains.. . As we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much melanin and will become a more transparent color - like gray, silver, or white - as it grows. As people continue to get older, fewer pigment cells will be around to produce melanin. Eventually, the hair will look completely gray. . . People can get gray hair at any age. Some people go gray at a young age - as early as when they are in high school or college - whereas others may be in their 30s or 40s before they see that first gray hair. How early we get gray hair is determined by our genes. This means that most of us will start having gray hairs around the same age that our parents or grandparents first did. . . Gray hair is more noticeable in people with darker hair because it stands out, but people with naturally lighter hair are just as likely to go gray. From the time a person notices a few gray hairs, it may take more than 10 years for all of that person's hair to turn gray. . . Some people think that a big shock or trauma can turn a person's hair white or gray overnight, but scientists don't really believe that this happens. Just in case, try not to freak out your parents too much. You don't want to be blamed for any of their gray hairs

Personally that stuff worked great until I ran out of the sample clay type cream you could put on individual pimples. You sound like you need a good exfoliator to get rid of some dead skin and smooth those "almost pimples" you can still see.

922849_0	I think that if people did lighten up and stop trying to spread the gospel (instead tried to live as an example to it) then the world would be a better place.

Now we've got that out the way, let's all smile and get drunk on the fermented grapes that the Lord has given us!

922849_14	Parental pressure when they are being raised. This approval seeking behavoir results in taking life seriously.
922849_15	I agree.  The secret to a long marriage, I've found out, is to have a sense of humor about life.  When kids spill things on the carpet that leaves a permanent stain you can get mad or realize that now you have a family story to tell for years.  When things don't go right laugh it off, take a deep breath, and keep plugging along.  If more people had a sense of humor about life and marriage, the divorce rate would not be around 60% as it currently is.  A little laughter goes a long ways.
922849_16	You might only get one! Better use it wisely....
922849_17	They don't know how to have fun.  What if this is all there is and there isn't anything beyond this life?  Think about that!
922849_18	Depends on how you mean to lighten up. If you mean by letting more immoral things just fly by- totally disagree. Look how much sex is on t.v. now-a-days it's disgusting.. . If you mean by ignoring the trivial stuff like gossiping and stupid immature stuff- then absolutely, too many people focus on the small picture that they ignore the bigger one.... . Take care and God Bless
922849_19	I dunno bout that. For me, the only way I'm able to lighten up a bit is to trust that God's got stuff under control. But yeah, I think the world would be a ton better if we could all learn to do that.
922849_20	Life is serious. It is one of the most serious Blessings of God. He did not have to allow any of us to live. He chose to allow us to exist on this earth. That is as serious as it can get.
922849_21	Well, truth be told, all the works of man, all that we do, is "dust in the wind." Sorry to quote an old song but it is true. So in the grand scheme of things we shouldn't be so serious all the time...yet for our brief moments on this earth so many suffer that it becomes necessary to be serious. So within the scope of a few years time we need to be serious and take the hardship of man seriously. Life appears to be the cheapest commodity on earth. For every soul lost there are a dozen more souls to take its place. So should we care? Should we be serious about all those strangers a thousand miles away who are not related to us? Yes, only if you take your own existence seriously can you value those others. In the US we make such a noise about one life lost in a robbery or a car wreck. We show the grief of parents over a lost child. But remember that those lost lives far away are also precious to those few whose lives they touched. . . So, do we need to lighten up or maybe take ourselves a little more seriously? The universe doesn't care about us, only we can care about us.
922849_22	I take things way too serious.
922849_23	Not everyone can go out to play everyday. The world would be a mess if no one was taking it serious. What is your definition of taking life serious? What does religion have to do with taking life serious? How do you suppose the world should lighten up?
922849_24	I agree.  I think religion, or the search for truth, should be about trying to improve your life.  I don't see how being all sour and angry about everything makes anything better.
922849_25	ommm. considering that we do die!!! its not like we live forever.
922849_26	Life is a gift of Almighty Allah (God), it should not be spoiled like any other routine things. Once you come to know about the real purpose of human creation then definitely you will also take it seriously. Please try to understand what you are for? and what for the life is? Basically life is to serve others and care for others.
922849_27	I take life seriously because Jesus said that our duty was to spread the Truth.  When I die I won't just fade away, I'll go to Heaven because I have accepted Jesus' free gift of undieing love and salvation.. . God Bless You,. Your Sister in Christ,. Holly
922849_28	I assure u that if u r 1 who thinks lke that there wud b many more...its actually own wish, human nature is varied, their backgrounds, education, families etc. u can find varieties of serious and light-hearted people in the same religion itself, so lighten up and do not worry, many things are changing, n we'd make a better place....just u n me;-)
922849_29	Why do you, as an Atheist, mingle with the religious crowd anyways. You shouldn't even be in this category, much less discuss religious matters with them. I can imagine that a lot of religious folk would be much happier if they didn't have the read the sarcastic and equivocal bull of many disbelievers.

922849_33	i couldn't agree more. i was actually accused of directing a question at some one in particular when i was just getting some opinions from a group of people. see my question asked of catholics and jews to see what i mean. this person all but called himself jesus and me satan. this guy could definitely use some lightening up.
922849_34	I often ponder this very question as I sit here in my chamber,,, napping, what cloudy garbage fills these peoples heads ...hark is that someone tapping at my chamber door.. I think if we all followed satan the world would be a richer and happier place... I mean all sins are instinct anyway aren't they .
922849_35	On the one hand, I totally agree. As a Christian I need to remember that the God of Heaven is always on his throne working all things together for good, so there's no need to worry.. . On the other hand, I have to consider that I only have one life to live and then comes the Bema Seat judgment of Christ where I will receive rewards for what I have done, whether good or bad.. . As a consequence of the second part, I have to be serious about the choices I make in life. I can't just "hope" that I'll do those things which will lead to eternal rewards. I have to compare my choices to God's revealed will in his Word and seek to be led by the Holy Spirit so that I am abiding in Christ when I make a choice.
922849_36	I think that the world should be taken with a grain of salt. Yes, you should take it seriously, but you should also have fun with it. The world would be much better off if everyone weren't so scared of hurting someone else's feelings with politically incorrect behavior. There are things you should take seriously like your education, your job and your family. But I think that some people think that they have to be serious about the things they take seriously. You can still have fun with something/someone that you take very seriously in your life.
922849_37	because sometimes through no fault of our own it gets serious IE when you lose loved ones or they get sick its all part of life
922849_38	the world is already lightened and happier.. If we have seen the light or if light and happiness touched us. Unless we get serious perhaps we wont be getting the answer :) . . Lots of lights and happiness for you. Cheers

"The Sun does indeed rotate. Galileo noted this nearly 400 years ago when he observed sunspots. As you can see from this animation, the apparent motion of the sunspots can be used to determine the rotation speed of the Sun.". http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=615. . Here's link to a short animation showing the rotation, http://collections.ic.gc.ca/universe/sun.html. . Another reference,. "Does the Sun rotate?. Indeed it does, but unlike the Earth or other solid bodies, the gaseous bulk of the Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles." http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q111.html. . Finally, from NASA's "Ask an Astrophysicist" archive,. "Yes, the Sun does rotate. We can observed this by observing sunspots. All sunspots move across the face of the Sun. This motion is part of the general rotation of the Sun on its axis. Observations also indicate that the Sun does not rotate as a solid body, but it spins differentially. That means that it rotates faster at the equator of the Sun and slower at its poles. (The gas giants Jupiter and Saturn also have differential rotation.) The movements of the sunspots indicate that the Sun rotates once every 27 days at the equator, but only once in 31 days at the poles." http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970108a.html
4032001_7	After engine shut down coolant temperatures actually will rise for a bit before it cools down. Check the coolant level after it has cooled to be sure it is not over filled. If the proper cold level is there, do not fill the expansion tank full. Engine coolant, when heated will expand and push coolant out of the over flow past the pressure cap. If the coolant level is not the trouble, have the pressure cap tested and if faulty replace. Be sure to use the recommended pressure rated cap. Water boils at 215 degrees F, but with a 50/50 mix anti-freeze and water and a 15 lbs pressure cap the coolant boil point raises to 230 degrees F. See the issue if you have incorrect levels of coolant, incorrect coolant mix or a bad pressure cap? The least cost is check for proper coolant levels, then costs occur from there.

986088_8	You can be 15 with a permit and a licensed driver in the car with you
1119420_0	Its a high frequency low wavelength light.can you see UV? no right? so it appears black.. also its monochomatic that you dont see the tinge of other light or colour...
1119420_1	it's invisible with wavelenth shorter than blue
1119420_2	It is black because the human eye can't see it.. . The visible colours are just one tiny part of the light spectrum which runs all the way from cosmic rays at one end to radio waves at the other. Most of that light of course is invisible. UV light is one part of that invisible light spectrum.
1119420_3	We say light travel in space with velocity 3 lac km/sec. It does mean the electromagnetic waves in technical term, not the visible light only. We are able to see as light a very short range of the spectrum of E - M waves (only 4000 - 8000 A wavelength)
1119420_4	Colors are determined by what wavelengths of light a substance absorbs and which it reflects. A substance that absorbs all colors is seen as black. White light is composed of all the wavelengths.. However the color spectrum carries more than just visible light, it also carries the infrared and ultraviolet(UV) spectrum, which is not visible to the human eye.. When white light passes through a black light, most visible light is absorbed, but ultraviolet light remains.
1119420_5	It is "light" just as red is.

2797224_0	People that are happy do not hate. Muslims hate anyone who is not a Muslim.
2797224_1	Gee where did you get those statistics???  I am happy and I am a Christian, but I don't know that all christians are happy.  How do you know that Muslims are the happiest.  Christ has answered all of my needs and questions, and has made me happy, but in the way that I am content with my life and I do not need to defend myself for what I believe, but I can.  So where do you get those statistics.  I see a lot of unhappy Muslims in the news in Iraq, Afganastan.
2797224_2	i just to say some thing to Mr. conradmex , i don't think that Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan are sad because of their religion but because of the religion of their enemies that allows them to kill innocents to reach their aim that they haven't reached it yet, . but generally i think Muslims are so happy , . but i have some other thing to say , i think all should really know about others religion , to can really feel their feeling.. enough.
2797224_3	I know some very happy Muslims, I know some very angry ones, some very proud ones, and some very abused ones (look at Muslims women in the Middle East and tell me they're happy).. . Sidenote:  Its the proud ones that seem to spew the most "Look how great I am, how great my religion is, look at what I have, and look at how shrewd I am to have gotten it so cheap!"  It rarely seems to be true.
2797224_4	dont know enlighten us. the details dont say much, if anything.

2797224_6	To DougDoug_. As a Muslim woman from the Middle East, I'd like to tell you that Muslim women in the Middle East are happy.
2797224_7	So, why can't I see this happiness when we see explosions, terrorism acts, invasions...etc?
2797224_8	Muslims are happy because they have the peace of mind, the harmony with everything and the great blessing of the holy Quran.
2797224_9	...hmmm...I don't know about Muslims but I have Joy in my life because I don't worry about material things. I know that all of my needs will be met.. . Phil 4:19 And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. . . All things will work together for good in my life as I become more like Jesus.. . Roman 8:28And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him,[j] who[k] have been called according to his purpose. 29For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. 30And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. . . I have a divine purpose for being here.. . Ephesians 2:10 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.. . And I'm looking forward to that Heavenly city to come where I will have fullness of joy and pleasures forevermore. (Hebrews 11). . Psalm 16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
2797224_10	Because Allah (SWT) revealed to us how to live a simple life.  If we follow his words, not only will we live a peaceful life but we will go to paradise.  How can we not be happy? We were blessed with such a wonderful religion:) And to sassy smart, your claim is completely false.  Allah (SWT) said we must respect everyone.  No hate can exist. I am a Muslim and I do not hate Non-Muslims.
2797224_11	I really think the happiest people in the world are those who are......HAPPY.. . Unless you the QURAN now includes a chapter where it claims Muslims MUST be happier than all the others, in which case i'd bend to Allah's will and would accept the view. We all know he's always Right.. In the meantime, could you pass on your question to the following groups of muslims?. . a) Muslims gays in all middle eastern countries, with particular reference to Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Iran?. b) All women in Middle Eastern countries, except Jordan, Lebanon, and a few others. c) Did you know in some African countries muslims adopted the non muslim practice of Infibulation, consisting in the surgical removal of the clitorid of women in order to deprive them from any source of sexual pleasure? The practice is done by an older woman without any specific tool, they just pull and cut.. d) Did you know that in other muslim countries they adopted the practice of sewing the vaginal lips always for the same reason, and that many of those women leave their country and have to undergo painful surgical interventions after that thraumatic experience?. g) did you know muslim immigrants still kill their daughters or sisters when they don't marry the men their parents tell them to marry. (see Germany, Turkey, Paksitan and several other places or simply check AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL). Did you know they burn their women to punish them or that they take them in the squares of their towns and kill them by lapidation with the participation of the whole citizenship?. h) Did you know in Saudi Arabia there is one of the highest rates of paedophilia?. i) Did you know muslims have one of the highest rates of homosexuality?. h) Did you know the highest number of rapists in Europe is made up of Muslims, which is even sadder if you consider their are still a minority in many countries?. If that's called happiness then i wonder what is to you unhappiness.. Good luck mate and God Bless you and your ideas(whoever he is)
2797224_12	I'm glad you are happy. I believe that Oneness Pentecostals are the happiest people on earth.
2797224_13	The only Muslims I have come across are full of "Hate" for their fellow man; Loise Farrakhan..called Jews dogs of the earth. We see daily Muslims rioting against Israel and America. They want to kill anyone who doesn't agree with the. Koran and it's teaching, especially about Mohammad. I think there are moderate Muslims that live in peace with their neighbors and cause no harm..but then there is the radical Muslims who hate Jews and Americans. We see this type of radical thinking in most of the worlds religions except for Judaism. I think the best things Muslims can do is to ask for the forgiveness of their murder and crimes against Israel..then the world can begin to forgive them for the evil they have done...Peace!
2797224_14	Some of the happiest people I have ever met have never heard of Moses, Jesus or Mohammed (among them a very old  Mayan woman in the Yucatan chanting over her husband's body.)  Some of the happiest people I know, are deeply devoted to principles carried forth by Moses, Jesus and Mohammed (among them some dancing dervishes in New York, a rabbi in Leominster, and a Capuchin monk in Montreal.)
2797224_15	Hi , its not only muslims that are happiest, others are to when they have found their own spiritual truth regardless of religion colour or creed.  a state of happiness exists when we dont harm others or judge others and can live with thoughts  that are pure as we can have them be and live to gether in harmony with others on this Earth respecting others views.  Happiness i avalable for all who would live the best way that they can with respect for  others.

98662_8	If you get a bad keg, that's rare... it's probably a problem with the keg itself, not the beer. You CANNOT get a skunked keg of beer, but the batch may be off.. . Beer skunks because of a reaction to light; beer in green bottles and clear bottles will skunk faster than beer in brown bottles. When beer fills a keg, it does not have enough time to skunk outside of the brewing keg. Ergo, it cannot skunk. But it could be a batch that's gone off because of age, or because it's been tapped and retapped incorrectly. If this is the case, then the place you got it is kind of sketchy. They shouldn't be selling "used" kegs. . . If you really think that you have a bad keg, don't drink it, 'cause, well, ew, but bring it back. If they give you a problem with it, don't let them; they can turn it back into the distributor for a full refund, so they shouldn't have a problem helping you out. They probably won't issue you a refund, but you may be able to change out the keg.. . Just don't try it if you've had more than a quarter of the keg; if they can feel the difference in weight, they're going to laugh you out of the store. If you go out for dinner and don't like your meal but you eat it, you're not going to get any sympathy.

2794017_1	1)typical atmospheric pressure is 1atmosphere or 10^2kilopascals or 760mmHg.. 2)Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.So external pressure decreases.As preessure decreases volume increases(if the temperature change is insignificant). 3)Water pressure increases with depth (P=h*density*g).So as external pressure increases the volumme decreases.. 4)Here we assume that the temperature doesn't change in the process.Use Boyle's law PV=P'V'. so 760*V=1.30*0.21. which gives V=3.59*10^-4L
2514686_3	Actually both are Chinese carps belong to the family Cyprinidae one of the largest family of fresh water fishes, All the barbs, puntius are from this group. I do agree that often there will be some confusion to identfy the Koi and Gold fish. Though they belong to different genera. there are reports having cross bread individuals. It is very difficult to identify especially in the young age. One striking difference is almost all gold fish scales are very shiny and koi may be colourful but not so shiny. The second important feature is Koi will grow very fast but gold fish comparatively low. The caudal fin of Koi always will be simple but gold fish mostly it is fan like. When you are selecting very small fishes, this can be easily noticed.If you need only gold fish select those have fan type caudal fin. Koi colour patches are not soo unique and attractive like gold fish but except the variety calico most of the gold fishes have definite and attractive patterns.Koi is ideal only for garden pools but gold fish can be from small indoor tanks to garden pools. Koi's basic stucture is very similar to Common carp and doenot have a pot belly similar to gold fish, Koi is more or less spindle shape with longer body than caudal fin but gold fish especially if they are young, caudal fin length is equal to the body length except in one or two cases. Gold fish body width wlll come down immediately after the stomach and form tail. But koi posterior part slowly narrow down to have a caudal peduncle to form a simple tail. I hope it may be clear now.

3614733_1	I assume you are dealing with a hot water tank rather than an instant-on hot water heater, and assuming there is no unusual pressure build-up in your hot water pipes.  The tank is pressurized, however, as the water heats  the hot water expands and this creates increased pressure within the tank.  As the water flows out of the tank, this pressure is released, thereby the presure in the tank goes down.  As hot water flows out of the tank, cold water flows in to replace it, and cooler water adds to reducing the pressure build-up.

1486348_0	the reason our skin itch sometimes is due to the effect of our own body immune system against antigen (foreign body not recognize by our immune system). .

2881224_6	One of the first signs of pregnancy is a late period. But missed periods do not necessarily mean that you are pregnant. If you’re sexually active and have missed a period, then it is worthwhile to take a pregnancy test. You may still want to take a pregnancy test even if you have been using contraception. Since birth control can fail, taking a pregnancy test will allow you to rule out one of the possible causes of missed periods. Your local pregnancy center can provide a test for free. . . If you have a late period and a negative pregnancy test, then consider whether or not you’ve recently been sick, gained or lost a significant amount of weight, have been under excessive stress or have taken any new medications. All of these things can affect your menstrual cycle and cause you to have irregular periods. Additionally, certain types of birth control, including the birth control pill, Depo-Provera and Norplant, can cause you to have menstrual cycles

3478928_0	You can start by reading the article "Starting a Janitorial and Cleaning Service Business" at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol95/janitorial.htm  The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. . . From the article, here are some tips:. . 1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. . . 2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. For effective techniques on cold calling, read "Tips to Successful Cold Calling"  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/blog/2006/05/tips-to-successful-cold-calling.html. . 3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.). . 4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.. . 5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.. . 6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. . . 7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.. . For detailed information I suggest you read the following books:. . - Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services . - The Janitorial Contractors Bible . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business . - Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor . - Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business

Mormon is a colloquial term used to refer to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, and most commonly to the movement's original and largest group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The term is derived from The Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith claims to have translated from ancient plates containing a history of the early inhabitants of the Americas that was compiled by a prophet called Mormon. Some mainstream Christian groups consider Mormonism as a cult.

2180086_2	Mormons are Christians who also believe the original church of Christ, as dictated in the New Testament, has been restored.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is led by actual revelation from God, and his authority has been given to us to perform ordinances such as baptism.

2180086_11	References: Mormon vs Biblical Teachings about Salvation . . . Bible quotations are from the New American Standard version. For information on sources of Mormon quotations, see the section titled "Mormon Documents".. . . . 1. Mormons teach that salvation (exaltation) comes through faith in Christ plus baptism plus works, i.e., we must add to the work of Christ. In the Bible 'salvation' means deliverance from the consequence (eternal separation from God) of our sin. Mormon leaders have redefined the word 'salvation' to have a two-fold meaning: a) forgiveness of sins and b) universal resurrection:. . "There will be a General Salvation for all in the sense in which that term is generally used, but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation" (Stephen L. Richards, Contributions of Joseph Smith, LDS tract, p.5). . "All men are saved by grace alone without any act on their part, meaning they are resurrected" (Bruce McConkie, What Mormons Think of Christ", LDS tract, p.28). . Thus, when a Mormon speaks of 'salvation by grace', he is usually referring to universal resurrection. Mormons use the term 'exaltation' to refer to attain a place in the highest level of heaven. The Mormon term 'exaltation' is more nearly equivalent to the Biblical term 'salvation'. What do Mormon leaders say about this?. . The Book of Mormon says of salvation: "for we know that is is by grace that we are saved, after all that we can do" (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 25:23). . The LDS Third Article of Faith states: "We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel" (Pearl of Great Price: Articles of Faith). . Joseph Fielding Smith explains what that last phrase means: "that which man merits through his own acts through life and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, p.134). . James Talmage explains: "...redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirement of the Gospel, and a life of good works" (James Talmage, in A Study of the Articles of Faith). . Spencer W. Kimball states: "however powerful the saving grace of Christ, it brings exaltation to no man who does not comply with the works of the gospel" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, pg. 207); "Each command we obey sends us another rung up the ladder to perfected manhood and toward godhood; and every law disobeyed is a sliding toward the bottom where man merges into the brute world" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pg. 153); "living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation...trying is not sufficient. Nor is repentence when one merely tries to abandon sin" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, p.164-165, 354-355). . Bruce McConkie claimed: "Jesus kept the commandments of his Father and thereby worked out his own salvation, and also set an example as to the way and the means whereby all men may be saved" (The Mortal Messiah, Vol.4, p.434). . What works do they mean? Here are some:. . Baptism for the dead: "The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead...Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at peril of their own salvation" (Joseph Smith, in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.356, 196). . Marriages sealed in the Temple: "Marriage is not only a righteous institution, but obedience to this law [Temple marriage] is absolutely necessary in order to obtain the highest exaltation in the Kingdom of God" (Milton R. Hunter, in Gospel Through the Ages, p.119). . Keeping the whole law: "To enter the celestial [kingdom] and obtain exaltation, it is necessary that the whole law be kept...Do you desire to enter the celestial Kingdom and receive eternal life?

484496_5	A human is naturally a little lighter than water so will float naturally.. Immediately when a person dies his body will begin to get rid of a lot of oxygen, and other gases, primarily from the lungs and the blood stream.  When these gases are expunged from the body, the body will sink.. After a while the remaining gases will begin interacting with the tissues and muscles and chemicals in the body and those gases will swell up, causing the body to float again.
484496_6	Due to the formation of air inside the tissues anf stomach
484496_7	When a man dies his/her cell starts to die individually, that is cell death(apoptosis) during the process each cell starts to swell due to release of organell bound enzymes inside the cell that cause lysis of organlls & releas of gases that cause swelling of the cell & eventually the organism volume increases relative to the mass,thus mass&#92;volume=density,decreases & the dead body floats!!

Unfortunately he didn't stop to consider (or perhaps didn't care) what this would mean to real human beings caught in the backlash. He now says he was just trying to bolster identification with the anthem, but then how does he explain the altered version he came out with turning the anthem into a doggerel theme song against immigration law enforcement? (It includes questions about how can we enforce these 'mean laws' against the 'hard workers' that I assure you are not in the original.). . I don't have a problem with people in any language expressing patriotism to this country, so long as that is what it is.  The message of when and how it was put out, along with groups touting Atzlan slogans and flying our flag upside down, gave it very different color.. . Kidron is here on a visa as I understand it. I hope any deportation feeling stirred up by his actions includes him, as well.

2022710_13	In a nutshell, because of breeding, selfishness, ignorance and insecurity. People feel bad about where they are in life, so they put other people down in order to make themselves feel better. They don't bother to study other religions, so they have no tolerance for ideas that do not fit in with their own ideologies. Also, their parents never taught them that it is rude to behave that way.. . Jesus taught that we should remove the plank from our own eyes before we try to remove the speck from the eye of our brother. Sin is like a stained glass window; you can't tap one piece out without breaking the whole window. What that means is that God doesn't look at one type of sin and view it differently from another type of sin. We humans are the ones who put a value on sin. . . People are selfish, which leads to judgementalism.

4018891_0	Terms and phrases cannot be copyrighted.  Terms and phrases are trademarked.  To check and see if a phrase is copyrighted, you can go to www.uspto.gov and use the TESS.  However, the TESS can never really be considered 100% accurate, so they only true way to know is if you try to trademark the word or phrase yourself, or contact the USPTO with an inquiry (I'm sure that costs something)
4018891_1	If Dragula is an actual name, like Drakula, then it can't be copywritten. Check out a name dictionary before you go to alot of copyright research.
4018891_2	have you checked with the studio munsters worked for also you could always change 1 letter
4018891_3	A single word cannot be copyrighted.  It can be a trademark, but that's different.  If you are not using it as a trademark yourself, I can't see what the problem is.. . On all these "infringement" questions, common sense and your own experience must rule the day.  Haven't you seen words and phrases, names even, that are used in normal newspapers, magazine articles, and books?  People say things like "I'll go get a Coke."  If it was illegal to use a trademarked name in that way, we'd never be able to say anything!  . . The basic rule in copyright is that if the ideas are, to your conscious mind, original to you, go ahead and use them.  If you purposely quote someone else, put it in quote marks and attribute it.  But if you just happen to choose the same words someone else in the past has used, that would not be an infringement.  However, if your entire chapter (or even a significant part of it) is word-for-word the same as someone else's, you're going to have trouble convincing a jury that you did not copy.. . Mama always said if you are honest, you don't have to worry about being sued.  That's something of an exaggeration in this modern litigious age, but it's about as good as we've got.  At least you don't have to worry about winning if you are sued!
4018891_4	You can trademark a word, but you can't copyright it.. . Copyrighted works can take on a variety of forms. Literary works, musical works, and dramatic works are included. Most digital media, including email, music, webpages, and graphics are also protected by copyright. Effectively, one should assume that anything someone creates and puts into a tangible form is copyrighted. . . Trust me, I am a librarian.. . There are also many items which cannot be copyrighted. For example, ideas and unrecorded choreographic works cannot be copyrighted. For a list of things that do not fall under copyright law, click here.
4018891_5	YOU do the same as a patent search but for copyrights
4018891_6	The tip off the word or phrase itself is legally protected by copyright is to look in any other public articles, for the word "Dragula", followed by a small circle with the letter "c" in it or a specific artwork design of the word, followed by a small all caps "TM" beside it.. . Doubts exist the word "Dragula" is copyright protected. "The actual phrase "I'll be back" (foreign accent spoken publicly) is allegedly protected by copyright by John Cameron, creator of the film "The Terminator".. . However, spoken in any other tone/accent, goes around the protection clauses of the phrase itself.  Now do you get the direction this example is going????
4018891_7	your best bet would be to get on the internet and check ot a government website.
4018891_8	In the USA, once a work is published (story, song, play, etc.), it is automatically copywritten, even if the author did not register it with the government copyright office. . The word Dragula was published several times (in the show, the play and in a song) and in all times is was connected to the original show. I would think that it is copywritten. . You might be able to get the rights to use the word (sometimes if costs nothing) from the author or the person holding the copyrights.
4018891_9	As I know, It should be written on it.
4018891_10	I believe that if it was used in the show it would be protected under the copyright of the show The Munsters.. It is a specific word used in a specific way on the show and I wouldn't use it unless I asked permission.. But what you can do is change it a little bit and it will be your word then. All you have to do to make a product different enough to market it as your product is a change of 10 percent.. So instead of it being Dragula spell it Draguala or something like that.. But I sure wouldn't put it in print without asking permission of the The Munsters owners or you might face a lawsuit. Better a little different and yours as a copy and theirs anyway don't you think?
4018891_11	If somebody sues you, what you used probably is copyright protected!
4018891_12	When it has a small c in a bubble next to it. If it doesn't try to look it up on google.
4018891_13	ask it
4018891_14	if it has a copywrite symbol(the letter c eith a circle around it) or trademark symbol(TM) next to it then it most likley is protected
4018891_15	If someone has already written it, its copyrighted.  No special process needs to be followed, copyrights apply automatically.  Trademarks and patents you have to go through a formal process to get, but not Copyrights.
4018891_16	Hey, you don't have to sweat. Just don't tell anybody about it. Oh no !!!!! What have you done !! You shouldn't have placed this question at the first place. Now everybody will get the idea about what you are up to and even if you do write something of your own, people will say ,"you copied it from someplace else". Simple, just keep your mouth shut.
4018891_17	search it on the enternet
4018891_18	google it.  Use google books!
4018891_19	Well Rob Zombie used it in a song and title of a song.. No one owns a word unless it is a brand name.
4018891_20	i don't think that word is copywritted. it's been used in several other things than the Munsters. Rob Zombie has a song called "Dragula" for instance.
4018891_21	A great question and some excellent information in the answers too. . . Thanks to all the serious users of answers.
4018891_22	A word such as that would typically be trademarked and not copyrighted.  You can check www.copyright.gov or uspto.gov and they have primers on the various laws.
4018891_23	the song Dragula by rob zombie is ©ed.
4018891_24	Dragula?  Is this a transvestite vampire?  Sorry, but I couldn't help that.  (I'm a huge fan of the Munsters as well as the Addams Family).. . Anyway, you can not copyright a phrase or term unless it refers to a particular product or service.  Even then, depending on the phrase, it usually winds up as an SM and not a TM.. . Hope this helps!
4018891_25	All you have to do is google the word, if it comes back copyrighted, then  you have to contact the entity that has the publishing rights of the name. It's a bit tedious, and it might take some time to accomplish, but you're better off doing things legit, than face legal action once their corporate lawyers catch wind of your infraction. Once  you find out who has the legal rights over the name, all you have to do is make a request in writing to use the name. Sometimes they are cool about it and will allow you to use the name for free, the only thing you'll have to do is list that they have authorized it on your book credit's portion. Sometimes they will charge you a fee, but it's usually bereable. Good luck.
4018891_26	it is copyrighted not eeverything can be protected because there is going to be limited words and terms to use
4018891_27	if its copyright it will say at the bottom of the site. but you might wanna contact the site owner
4018891_28	Check out any claims through the copyright laws of the US.
4018891_29	for your particular case, is there a way you can contact the producer(s) or major companies involved in the munsters? i think that would be the best bet- to look up information about the munsters and call or email the highest authorities involved.
4018891_30	It may not be copyrighted from the Munsters, but it is copyrighted from the song Dragula by Rob Zombie. . . http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robzombie/dragula.html
4018891_31	I don't think so, because this word was used more than once by many different people:. -On TV. On The Munsters, Grandpa Munster create the vehicle to win back The Munster Koach after Herman lost it in a drag race.. . . In The Movies. In 1966, a movie called Munster Go Home featured Herman Munster driving Dragula in a cross-country race, surviving various attempts on his life until at the very end of the movie he wins the race by sliding backwards across the finish line because of an oil slick.. . . In Music. Rob Zombie made a song Dragula for his album Hellbilly Deluxe.. . And the musician is not related, and was never sued or asked why did he use it. Good luck with your book.
4018891_32	Don't worry about it. If you know the source and you give credit to the source in your footnotes nobody can touch you if it is copyrighted or not.The problems only come if you don't know the source or credit the wrong source.
4018891_33	Go to www.ask.com type the phrase and see what comes up
4018891_34	You just got featured question.  It is already copyrighted.
4018891_35	You can do some searches online at the PTO. I honestly doubt the word is copyrighted. Now if you use a similar character you may have issues there.
4018891_36	You'll know if you get sued.
4018891_37	You'd have to go check the copyright office in washington D.C. I believe they charge to have you search the archives but that'd be the sure way to know.
4018891_38	It's probably not, just contact the show and ask for permission to use it anyways.... You would not believe how many people Cornelia Funke got permission from in "Inkheart".  The last few pages of her book are covered in permissions for everything..
4018891_39	Single words can't be copyrighted, they're trademarked.  Run a search at http://www.uspto.gov/main/trademarks.htm to see if it's trademarked.
4018891_40	write a letter to the creator of the show or some one  who was involved with that show and say could i please u the that u said and they should mail you back in about 4-6 weeks if more help needed my emails are below
4018891_41	what a dumb question!
4018891_42	If a word was originally used, the best way to know if it is copyrighted is to ask the original user or the Copyright Bureau in your territory or the territory where the word or phrase has originated. Then again, if you want to copy something, whether it is copyrighted or not, you ahould ask permission. This is the first ethic of being a new author. I did a little studies in that and this is the first thing I was taught. Quote people when you use their words and be sure to ask for permission if you want to publich anything in black and white.
4018891_43	There are a couple of ways to check, start by going to . www.copyright.gov or www.uspt.gov check out the U.S. Office of Copyrights. . The laws involved in copyrighting a single word might require you to give a credit in the footnotes.
4018891_44	Ask the goverment! They seem to know everything!.    For Real!
4018891_45	if you google it and cant find out then you might want to try a web site like turnitin.com and see what it tells you.
4018891_46	if if is in a book, then on the copyright page there would be a copyright date, and publisher, and the place where the book is published.
4018891_47	look on the back of the item.
4018891_48	www.copyright.gov/ - You can search online.
4018891_49	there wud be mentioned with a symbol c in a small circle
4018891_50	try to just spell it different or something to put your own little twist on it
4018891_51	research it on google or another search engine
4018891_52	Consult a lawyer.  Yahoo! Answers is not the place for a technical question like this, as can be seen by some of the blatantly-incorrect answers already given.  Consider what you would rather say to a judge if you end up in court -- "I consulted with my lawyer and acted on his/her advice" or "some people on Yahoo! Answers said this would be OK."
4018891_53	Well, you could do one of two things:. . 1) Try to copyright the word, and if the Munsters sue you, you know it's copyrighted.. . 2) Call the Munsters and ask them if the Dragula is a copyrighted word. Rob Zombie used it as a title for one of his songs, so I'm sure they would let you.
4018891_54	I know that in England copyrighting is free. You need to include the copyright symbol on all your published work, with your name and the year you created the work. I am pretty sure also, that all on the internet is automatically copyrighted as long as you use what I just mentioned. Check your country patent office but in England, like I said it is free.. It doesn't mean your work won't get stolen, but you will then have rights to sue them for infringement. With these copyright symbols on your work, you will have more chance of winning any lawsuits in the future.. Check it out, simply do a Google search for "Copyright laws" but if publishing on the internet, then nothing really protects unless you see your work being sold, then it's up to you to pursue what is rightfully yours.. Oh, you want to check if protected, simply ask Google, you'll know once been in there
4018891_55	No it has become a common word you can use it.
4018891_56	YOU GET YOUR ASS SUED IF YOU USE IT
4018891_57	reth
4018891_58	Try www.uspt.gov (US Pattent and Trademarks) and try from there.
4018891_59	It depends on a country by country basis.  I know copyrighting and trademarks authorisations are quite different in Australia compared to the USA and the UK.  I suggest you use a search engine to do a bit more sleuthing.
4018891_60	As the word "Dragula" is in a script of "The Munsters," it means, the  U.S. copyright law protects EVERYTHING in a script.  . . I am sure you would say the same thing about everything in your script.    . . Protect yourself, call the U.S. copyright office, they will clarify for you.  . . As I am sure you know, there have been several recent lawsuits regarding copyright infringement.  Writers do not take this lightly and are suing writers.  You don't want a lawsuit when the writers find out about you appropriating their "word."
4018891_61	there is usually a c with a circle around it nearby, at the bottom of a webpage, in the front of a book, or right next to the word. y don't you just change 1 letter in it or call up TV land or soemthing. I am a budding author too... but I don't know anything about copyright in tv series... I don't think things in tv series CAN be copyrighted...
4018891_62	it will say COPYRIGHT who cares use it
4018891_63	You can try google scholar as well.
4018891_64	it is simple majority say copyright under them

4018891_66	Check with the library of congress
4018891_67	you can tell about it of how it looks  and you could know about it too
4018891_68	If you are going to use it in a character in your writings you better check if it is a trademark.. Otherwise, if you know the origin and reference it, there should be no problem as long as it is not a valid trademark for a product or service
4018891_69	everyone has the right to use what ever word they wants to . so it's really up to u if u want to use it or not
4018891_70	Do what "lawtech" says. I needed to do the same thing for my business name. They told me not to write it with the same design or use it in the same way as other companies.
4018891_71	get the information in which you wish to know if it is copyrighted and copy it and paste it on a google website. If it is copyrighted it will show the souce in which it had been copied from!
4018891_72	theres a cool website that my teachers uses to check if our work been copyright.. Turnitin.com.. its really good...try it..
4018891_73	Go to http://www.copyright.gov/
4018891_74	If it is not a common word, and it was written down in a literary work, then chances are it is under copyright.  If it was trademarked it would have the (TM) after it.. . Now seeing as how it was used before and after the US signed the Berne Convention in 1989, I would assume that Rob Zombie has the copyright.
243520_3	if you need money you can borrow up to 90 % of the cash surrender value in most policies--you do not need to cancel the policy if you still need the life insurance coverage- if you have owned the policy for ten yrs or longer and its from a mutual co. like Prudential--you are better off keeping the policy, because the dividends on the policy plus the anuual increase in the cash surrender value probably equal or exceed the annual premium--if you have any other questions-write me at bearloverrich@yahoo.com --i am a retired independent insurance broker & CPA & CFP & LUTCF and spent over 30 yrs helping people with insurance and financial and estate planning--or call the agent from the company and ask him what are your choices--an annuity withdrawal is when you get the money in monthly annuity payments like a pension, instead of a lump sum at one time- hope this helps you out- borrow on the policy instead of cancelling it if you can-that would probably be the best thing to do !!
1742397_0	By definition, at absolute zero, nothing is moving.. . Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles of a system.  At absolute Zero (0 K), the partciles have stopped completely.  If all the particples have stopped, there is not way that it is going to move up/down/side to side since if it did, it would have some temperature ad thus not be at absolute zero.
1742397_4	Because of the weak interatomic forces, helium remains liquid down to absolute zero; helium solidifies only under great pressure. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5 K and about 26 standard atmospheres (2.6 MPa) of pressure. At sufficiently low temperature, both helium-3 and helium-4 undergo a transition to a superfluid phase. Superfluidity is a phase of matter characterised by the complete absence of viscosity (measure of the resistance of a fluid to deform under shear stress. It is commonly perceived as "thickness", or resistance to pouring). Thus superfluids, placed in a closed loop, can flow endlessly without friction.. . But getting a temperature of 1 - 1.5k is not possible outside of a laboratory, so in THEORY, it can roll uphill. Absolute Zero is not possible on earth, because of interaction between molecules in the atmosphere.

1159341_3	Why did Muslims fly four jet airliners full of people into buildings here in the US, killing thousands of innocent people?  Why?  To control the world as the Quran instructs and delete Western civilization?
1167882_0	Sin is the affect of an earlier problem.Sin occurs mainly after temptation has been acted upon by our spirit and body.Sin is something that if not repented of will lead to death not in the bodily sense alone but spiritual as well."The second death" as it is called is what punishment is aquired for the acummulation of unrepented sin.Actually if a person is baptized into Christ and has repented and living the Christian life as best they can there will still be sin.Thing is we then have the privledge to ask forgiveness of sins as long as we try not to sin which is what repent actually broken down means.To turn from sin.Sin actually is no worse than another sin for instance Christ only really spoke of one and that is blasphemy and it is the worst of all.Sexual sin is a biggy but only because when you are baptized into Christ's body then you have the holy spirit within you.So having sex you are involving the holy spirit which lives inside of you which is definetly not good.Sin for the most part is equal.For instance some so called christians say that homosexuality is worse than other sins but in reality if I looked upon a woman sexually it is no worse than if a man looks at another man that way or vice versa.Just remember that sin is an act not something we are born with as calvinists and catholics believe.A baby that cannot walk talk or have sex cannot sin!Therefore it doesnt need baptism as a baby as they say besides a baby cannot confess Christ as Lord nor repent of sins for it has none.Hope this helps
1167882_1	There's bad sin and really bad sin(abomination).  Rev 21:27. Luke 16:15, Lev.7:18.. I Corinthians 13:;8a, Love never fails.
1167882_2	Sins are caused by demons, don't you know?. . . . . . . . . lol, I don't believe in the existence of god.
1167882_3	SIN is not believing the words of the Bible are true, also called unbelief. And sins are what mankind does because we do not believe the Bibles. 1 Corinthians 5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. Mark 10:19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. Romans 13:9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God..  . This is by no means a complete list but all of these are sins, but all a Christian has to do is ask for forgiveness, believe you are forgiven and realize this was why Jesus Christ had to die, for your unbelief in God's word. Realizing you are a sinner by nature, you do not become discouraged by your failing.
1167882_4	Well there is the seven deadly sins...Murder, Lust, Greed, Gluttony, Stealing, Lying, and Christianity...The last three go together as Christianity is based on lies, and stealing,(in as much as the rituals and holidays they use were in practice BEFORE the birth of Christ).
1167882_5	Sorry. but SIN does not exist.. so there are no difference between one kind of a thing That Does Not Exist and another thing That Does Not Exist
1167882_6	the idea of sin is relative to what you think is right and wrong.  therefore, there is no such thing as sin.
1167882_7	GOOGLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
1167882_8	the only sin that will get you into hell, is rejecting Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior.. . All the other sins were dealt with at the cross, so you dont need to worry about them if youve accepted Jesus as Lord. Coz the bible, will show you how to overcome all other sin.. . but as a non believer, the wages of sin is eventually death, and eternal hell. Coz they havent repented of the only sin that needs to be dealt with for eternal life.. . its a long long story, ask God, read the word of God. you will find your answers

1371653_1	What does the test result mean?. Moderately elevated ESR occurs with inflammation, but also with anemia, infection, pregnancy, and old age. . . A very high ESR usually has an obvious cause, such as a marked increase in globulins that can be due to a severe infection. The doctor will use other follow-up tests, such as cultures, depending on the patient’s symptoms. Persons with multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (tumors that make large amounts of immunoglobulins) typically have very high ESRs even if they don't have inflammation. As noted before, polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis may also have very high ESRs. . . . . Im not sure what you want to know about the ESR blood test.This is just a little info,

1349985_7	I found this in researching your question: . "...The Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to a Harvard proposal to test the benefits of the illegal street drug known as "ecstasy" in patients diagnosed with severe anxiety related to advanced cancer.. The drug, also known as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, has been referred to by psychiatrists as an "empathogen," a drug especially good at putting people in touch with their emotions. Some believe it could help patients come to terms with the biggest emotional challenge of all: the end of life.". In other words, ecstacy is being TESTED to see if it has any medicinal value in helping terminally ill [and/or] cancer patients, as well as diagnosed PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) patients. The emphasis is on medicinal value; it is not being tested for use by party/crack heads who want to damage their remaining brain cells.... Hope this helps!
2814722_0	I agree with you. Although I am not a smoker, we don't ban alcohol or other things that could ''POSSIBLY IN THE LONG RUN CAUSE YOU HARM'', why do they get away with doing that to tobacco...how about Potato Chips????
2814722_1	It may be your establishment, but you still have to answer to the government.  I think its a good bad, too!  Smokers should be treated like 2nd class citizens because that's what they are, weak minded fools who can't even control their addiction to nicotene, they should be relegated to 2nd class.
2814722_2	Smoking crack is illegal anywhere, why shouldn't smoking tobacco? With enough use, both drugs will kill you.
2814722_3	Might be crimes against humanity.  Second hand smoke is a deadly affliction for some.  I'm a 22 year veteran smoker who quit three years ago and don't believe it is easy for people to quit and I don't preach, but I don't like to dine in places with smokers now, so I am glad these laws are in place.  I wish everyone could quit.  I don't think it would put millions out of work.  There would be millions off new jobs created from the fall out and lots of healthy people to do the work.  have fun!
2814722_4	isn't the damage to the people working/coming into the establishment unconstitutional?. . Around the world this sort of legislation is being brought in - much as I appreciate the changes this will cause to smokers it is absolutely the right thing to get rid of the scourge of smoking.
2814722_5	Because anyone who smokes is a IDIOT! . Imagine...we're all worried about getting. breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc.... and IDIOTS actually PAY the tobacco company . to hopefully get cancer!
2814722_6	well, i guess it's not ban because they are bettering people around them's health.  They are trying to regulate that for the whole country, like no smoking in bars.  They found out that the second hand smoke can still give someone lung cancer so because everyone has the right to "life, liberty and purstuit of happiness", then figure they are protecting other people's unalienable rights by taking away other rights that are taken for granted.
2814722_7	What does the law say? No smoking in public. I think that's a great law. If we all wanted to smoke, we light one of our own. But if it has to do with smoking at home, I think that's wrong. If you want to kill yourself and not hurt others in the process, then that's fine.. . Hey Bunchick, Why don't they ban tanning beds or sunbathing? How 'bout all the smog we inhale?
2814722_8	No where in the constitution does it have any protection for those wishing to smoke.Second hand smoke kills. Benjamin Franklin once said, the Freedom of your swing ends at the tip of my nose, the same can be said for smokers , the freedom of you polluting your lungs ends when it begins to pollute mine.A seperate room for smokers would be the best way to do it.
2814722_9	Because the constitution guarantees people "life" and second-hand smoke kills people.  There is nothing in the constitution that guarantees restaurant owners the right to allow smoking in their establishments.
2814722_10	We have the same ban in Los Angeles, if the establishment is less than 50 people capacity, you can't smoke, because it doesn't have a smoking section.  The only way you can get around it is if you own the place and have owned the place for x amount of years.
2814722_11	because its not unconstitutional?
2814722_12	Get over yourself, you pathetic tobacco addict.

1736899_10	Afghanistan is, and was, supposed to be a light touch war to assist the Afghans themselves to overthrow the Taleban.. . For once the west were sensitive to the fact that Afghans have been killing each other cheerfully for 500 years but the only thing that has ever united them is a foreign invader (Persians, Indians, British, Russians etc).. . They all stop fighting each other for a while, beat the invader, and then go back to killing each other. Its just they way they are and always have been.. . Therefore the idea is that the US and Brit forces over there are transitional into a NATO force, and eventually U.N force to "assist" the new government with security. Not to prosecute a war.. . Iraq is similar, but with the added subtelty that it is acting as a magnet for anti western lunatics everywhere to come and have a crack at the U.S and her allies.. . What I believe the strategy is, is that the allies are allowing this to happen as the current rate of attrition is 70 - 100 insurgents killed for every allied soldier killed or wounded.. . In any war that is an acceptable battlefield ratio and one where the west is winning. Also for every nutter who goes to Iraq and runs at a tank with an AK47 there is one less suicide bomber to go on the subway in New York.

454776_16	No Christian country faired very well persecuting their Jewish minority, look at spain, it used to be the richest country in the world, in todays money its wealth would be more then america's budget of the past 50 years, most of their gold was plundered by revenging Jewish pirates in the carrebian (most caribian islands have jewish cemetries with pirate signs on graves), who knows where the Gold whent, allot was sunk, some whent to the Dutch as they let in the jewish expellees, some reinvested in America and some hidden in places only the dead pirates know of.. . Whilst jews genraly dont go on a avengence campain, the downfall of spain in a mere 10 years left an impression on mideval europe about what the Jews are when they are in their country, and what their country is when the jews are not there. The Jewish Talmud makes its students more sharper then those who are not.. . So chrisitans arent interesting in starting another jewish persocution age, and Islam reared up its own head againt christanity. Jews living in arab lands where called dimis, they where servants of the states with little to no rights, when all the Jews left the arab countries, the arabs where very scared on what would be. So when they attack, they think they are attacking both christian and the jews who whent to the other side of the fence with them.

2264846_0	One of the other responses is correct in one sense that the ultimate efficiency of an internal combustion engine is determined by its compression ratio and operating temperature.  However, those things being equal, the engine with the lower amount of rotating mass will produce more output power per unit of fuel.  As one of the responses mentioned, lighter pistons can affect the efficiency, as can the design, e.g., a roller cam, overhead cam designs vs. rocker arms, a shorter stroke (sometimes), can all affect the comparative efficiency.  One glaring example of how rotating mass and internal friction can affect such is that better oils can improve fuel efficiency by reducing internal friction and lighter pistons can as well by reducing the amount of internal poser usage to accelerate and decelerate the pistons as they travel.
4031278_15	yes, most jobs now days like it if you have a college degree, they will pay you more, and its how america plans to compete in the global world, with foriegn schools learning more at a younger age we have to keep learning things past high school in order to be caught up with them. College is a good opertunity to learn who you are, thats why I think people should go to college, it gives you a transition between high school were your kinda protected by your parents and the real world were you are supposed to know everything, even though most fake it. I think its a good opertunity for people that we take advantage of.
3165940_1	simple, a black hole absorbs everything, including light, and with no light reflecting back at you, it appears to you dark, ink or black paper does not necessarily absorb all 100% of the light entering it, but a black hole does
3165940_2	haha because you see black when no light comes back to you.  the reason black ink or black paper is black is it is absorbing a very large amount of light.  the thing about a black hole is, its so strong it absorbs ALL the light that comes even close to it, so you see nothing but blackness
3165940_3	That's because black holes absorb all light that falls into their event horizon, or the point past which you can't escape their gravity even if you move at the speed of light.  Black ink and black paper reflect some light-they aren't completely black.
3165940_5	it is darker because it is compltetely black and black ink may be comp. black there is light shining on it and there is no light shining around a black hole.

2643507_1	Were dinosaurs milked? How much was a gal. back then I wonder? I bet it was VERY expensive! Wonder if they had poor immigrants do the milking? I bet many were killed.
2643507_2	Does it?. the last time I went out Gas cost more than Milk per gal., so I put gallon of milk in my car.
2643507_3	Lol. You're funny
2643507_4	Initially I thought you were complaining about the price of milk.  But you are absolutely right, it makes no senses for a renewable agricultural product to cost more than a rapidly-dwindling non-replaceable (at least in  the short-term) product.. . I suspect the answer to your question lays with the US consumer, who believes in the free market up to the point where it impacts 'vehicle rights'! LOL. . Gas prices will rise above milk soon, they aren't making any new oil...
2643507_5	I do not know where you live, but in California it doesn't.

2643507_10	for squeezing milk u have to put more effort!
2643507_11	how the hell did dinosaurs get into the question?  u r very creative ill give ya that.
2643507_12	Simple answer is that the more rare the thing is it costs more . Milk production is less than gas production.. . The more largescale plant the less is the cost.. Gas plants r like dinosaurs & milk plants r relatively small in size.. . The more middlemans the more is cost.. In the case of Milk collection & distribution there r large number of middle mens r involved than gas distribution system.. . Milk is not having long life & good preservation methods relative to gas, hence weastage of milk is relatively large.. . I will let u know more things when my wife will start giving milk & bad smells of gases to me.. hahahaha............
2643507_13	Milk costs more, without sales, because of the cost involved in producing packaging, and transporting it. Cows need to be born and raised, given shots and medical care, fed and housed. They produce a limited amount of milk each day. Then the milk gets pasteurized and packaged in individual containers, and has to be transported in a way that keeps it cold the whole time. If it is on the shelf or in transit too long, you won't be able to drink it. Oil on the other hand is already in the ground and is pipelined to a place where it can be pumped into ships, trucks, or barrels. It doesn't need to stay cold and lasts forever. It can be transported without the expense of individual packages. Contrary to what many think today, there are still abundant supplies of it. As the supply decreases, the price will go up to above that of milk. In countries closer to the source, such as Kuwait, gas only costs about 82 cents per gallon, which is less than the cost of water there!
2643507_14	That's a good question...
2643507_15	Not everywhere.  I paid $2.29 for a gallon of milk yesterday.  Gas is about $2.75 a gallon.
2643507_16	Gas definitely costs more here in the UK!
2643507_17	Well, I anticipate that Wal-Mart will soon be selling gasoline in plastic jugs for $3.00+ a gallon.. . Of course, the Premium will not be homogenized...
2643507_18	It is considered a "loss leader" in the grocery industry.  That's why it is always at the back or side of the store.  They know you will need it so they make you walk through the store hoping you will buy something else.
2643507_19	Good question, but you must consider that as gas prices raise, so do Milk prices.  Costs farmers more to feed (transporting food), more to work (gas on farm use) and more to get to a store (gas to the store).  All of that is added in the price of milk in addition to normal costs and things I know I've left out.  So it'll continue to increase as gas does which is why right now it's over the price of gas (actually always has been).
2643507_20	It doesn't where I live

3872395_2	make sure you follow their routine down to the letter and you shouldnt have any problems
3872395_3	Keep them active right up to bath time then after bath read to them. If this doesn't put them to sleep, then put some really soft music on to play. Something soothing. Don't fall for the need a drink of water trick or you'll have them up going to the bathroom constantly
3872395_4	say in a nice way, I'm going to sleep but you can't because _________.then they'll want to go to sleep because it sounds like a treat.
3872395_5	Tire them out.  Play races, kickball, ect.. if it is nice out.  If it isn't nice out then color, play hide and go seek, or read them stories.  If none of this works as the parents what they do and if it is okay if they stay awake past the bedtime.  Never give a child liquoir or medication, just to get them to sleep.

174372_12	yes...however i believe this has been greatly misunderstood..... . Jesus said, except a person is born again they cannot enter the kingdom of God....being born again is "baptism"...you are spiritually baptised, or washed clean by the blood of Jesus Christ, hence dead to sin and resurrected to "newness of life" or "born again".... . water baptism is simply the physical representation of the spiritual baptsim "being born again"....just like physical circumcision is the representation of the circumcision of the heart, and physical circumcision of itself cannot save you....these all agree as one "baptism"...i suggest you read 1 John 5:7-9 and check out this question  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuRxzgcmGxx6BNwlJnurKe_sy6IX?qid=1006051635169   . . it is an important passage to understand baptism...pray over it, and may the Lord show you the truth hidden in its words...
174372_17	I don't believe so.  If that were the case, stillborn children would be punished for not dying after baptism; children of atheists who pass away before ever having a chance to discover their own relationship with God would be punished.  I don't believe God works like that.

Sometimes the rudeness could come from feeling stupid for not knowing the answers; more often, I would suspect that people think that the questions being ask are for the answers rather than help getting to the answers. The reason for homework is to give the student a learning exercise. We take that away when we just hand out answers. If questions were ask in a way that helped the student learn rather than to just give the answer, the people answering may tend to be more tolerable.

34041_0	There are multiple symptoms of strep throat.  It depends on age also.  generally look and feel awful with strep throat! They can have high fevers, very painful throats, often severe difficulty swallowing, and pus which can sometimes be seen covering the tonsils.

34041_3	check the back of the throat, if there are white spots then that's possibly strep. Also coughing, sore throat, fever and swollen lymph nodes are symptoms as well.
34041_4	Swollen glands, white spots in back of throat, bleeding of tonsils, fever sometimes etc...if it's very painful to swallow you probably have it. Antibiotics can fix it rather quickly though. Also drink hot chicken broth and use that chloroseptic spray. I get strep a lot and those are my remedies! Good luck ;-)
34041_5	Common symptoms of strep throat in children and adults include:. .     * Severe and sudden sore throat without coughing, sneezing, or other coldlike symptoms..     * Pain or difficulty with swallowing..     * Fever over 101 °F(38.3 °C); lower fevers may indicate a viral infection and not strep..     * Swollen lymph nodes in the neck..     * White or yellow spots or coating on the throat and tonsils..     * Bright red throat or dark red spots on the roof of the mouth at the back near the throat..     * Swollen tonsils, although this symptom may also be caused by a viral infection.

34041_7	throat irritation, redness of the throat with white slpotches.....you can go to your physician and ask for a throat culture to find out if it's strep for sure as oppose to a different bacteria. if it is strep ask for zythromax...also known as a z-pack. it's a strep specific antibiotic....otherwise you'll probably get ammoxacillin which is a broad spectrum antibiotic which can kill strep as well as other bacteria such as chlamydia infections of the mouth

3341098_4	The events which led to the Witch Trials actually occurred in what is now the town of Danvers, then a parish of Salem Town, known as Salem Village. Launching the hysteria was the bizarre, seemingly inexplicable behavior of two young girls; the daughter, Betty, and the niece, Abigail Williams, of the Salem Village minister, Reverend Samuel Parris.  .      . The Witch House  In February, 1692, three accused women were examined by Magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne. Corwin's home, known as the Witch House, still stands at the corner of North and Essex Streets in Salem, providing guided tours and tales of the first witchcraft trials. John Hathorne, an ancestor of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, is buried in the Charter Street Old Burying Point.   .    By the time the hysteria had spent itself, 24 people had died. Nineteen were hanged on Gallows Hill in Salem Town, but some died in prison. Giles Corey at first pleaded not guilty to charges of witchcraft, but subsequently refused to stand trial. This refusal meant he could not be convicted legally. However, his examiners chose to subject him to interrogation by the placing of stone weights on his body. He survived this brutal torture for two days before dying. . It is remarkable 552 original documents pertaining to the witchcraft trials have been preserved and are still stored by the Peabody Essex Museum. . . Eerie memorabilia associated with the trials, such as the "Witch Pins" used in the examination of witches and a small bottle supposed to contain the finger bones of the victim George Jacobs can be found there as well. .     .   *These short paragraphs are intended only as an introduction to a complex subject about which much has been written.  .

From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been convicted of witchcraft, were carted to Gallows Hill, a barren slope near Salem Village, for hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft. Dozens languished in jail for months without trials.  Then, almost as soon as it had begun, the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts ended. .     Why did this travesty of justice occur? Why did it occur in Salem? Nothing about this tragedy was inevitable.

4049097_18	The Da Vinci code may be fiction, but the concept of the Catholic Church being deceptive (that's the nicest way I will say it) is a proven fact.. . The problem that the church sees is that many Catholics, especially in light of all the REAL conspiracies that have been uncovered in the last decade or so, are going to get the seed planted in their minds, that maybe their church isn't perfect.. . And once that seed is planted, a cursory examination of the church's history will make non-believers out of every last one of them.

1949736_1	WATER IS NOT MOVED BY ACTIVE TRANSPORT!!! Water is moved by Osmosis (diffusion of water molecules through a selectively permeable membrance DOWN a concentration gradient). Active Tansport requires Adenosine Tri-Phosphate or simply ATP molecules. Energy is used to move particles FROM area where they are in LOW concentration to area where they are HIGH in concentration. AGAINST a concentration gradient. USUALLY through a Transport Protien! active transport is AGAINST the Concentration gradient!

2442758_7	Catholicism is a denomination within Christianity. So Catholics are Christians. Problem solved. However, your question may be more related to inter-denominational relationships. In that case, it just depends upon how different the non-Catholic person's religious perspective is in relation to Catholicism. I am not Catholic, but am married to a Catholic, and we've been together for many years.

4139889_0	Wind is the roughly horizontal movement of air (as opposed to an air current) caused by uneven heating of the Earth's surface. It occurs at all scales, from local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting tens of minutes to global winds resulting from solar heating of the Earth. The two major influences on the atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect).

1209792_4	find a good recipe or ask someone you think is a good cook   and while you are frying smile and say i can fry good chicken  ENJOY
1209792_7	heat your pan on high with grease melting. make sure your chicken is throughly washed and all the fat is gone. Well all the fat that is on the sides of the chicken that will cook off while frying. Make a batter of flour, seasoning salt, and chicken seasoning if your desire. Most people use an egg wash or buttermilk to coat the chicken in and then batter it but I don't. Once your oil or grease is heated and ready slowly put battered chicken in the frying pan and once the firat side has cooked, turn the temperature down to medium or medium-high. Finish cooking the rest of the chicken and make sure to periodically check the chicken to make sure it is fully cooked meaning not bleeding or no red areas in the chicken. You could also use Fish Fry batter instead of adding ingredients. For spicy chicken add curry, red peppers, chilli powder, crushed jalapenos in batter or tabasco sauce while cooking. There is also a hot sauce called Spontaneous Combustion. This stuff will make any food very hot. You may not be able to finish it because your mouth is on fire.

3376143_2	If you are asking about antibodies attacking non self, this is essentially immunology.. The body is designed to try and kill anything that is non self (ie bacteria, parasites, virus infected cells etc) The body does this by recognising molecules on the invading organism as non self and consequently destroys the cell by a number of mechanisms within the body, some of these are simple innate mechanisms, where the cell is essentially eating by cells such as macrophages, or there are more complex mechanisms known as the adaptive immune system which can include antibody production and cytotoxic t cells. Antibodies themself are not able to attack molecules, but essentially act as a signal to cells within the immune system that something is foreign.... Hope this helps!!!. Katie
4061429_3	Planes travel at a faster speed and usually take a more direct path to their destination.  Trains often make stops to load and unload passengers.  Also because they travel on the ground, trains have to weave through mountains.  Tracks sometimes have to work around established neighborhoods or roads.  Sometimes trains are not allowed to go fast in certain areas because there are a lot of cars travelling in that area.  Airplanes just fly above all of this.
1497821_2	It will vary by language and culture.  Related to American English idioms, I have seen dictionaries of idioms written to assist non-native speakers of the language.  I would guess that the first clue in recognizing an idiomatic term or phrase would be first to analyze the literal meaning, if that makes no sense in any of the combination of literal meanings, then the next step would be to consider that it might be an idiomatic phrase or term.  Also, ask a native speaker of the particular dialect of the language.

286448_4	For piston engine airplane, they use supercharged method or turbo to compress more air to engine.  However, above 10k ft even a turbo and supercharged enginer will not be efficent.  So, piston engine airplane is designed to fly less than 10k ft. . . As far as jet engine, they lose engine power as altitude goes up.  But as higher altitude with less air density, the drag will go down as well.  Therefore less engine power is needed for crusing at high altitude.

2734659_4	Someone I know home schools her kids and I asked her the same question.  For her, it was the religious aspect of it based on 2 points:  1.  that public schools leave out religious teachings, and 2.  there are no Mormon private schools (at least not where she lives).  But I imagine the Mormon part of it (point #2) was probably more important to her than the fact that religion is left out of public schools -  if it wasn't more important, then she could have easily enrolled them in any Christian private school.

678951_0	Alcohol was banned in the US during prohibition, but it was a terrible failure.  The bible doesn't forbid alcohol, it states that you shouldn't get drunk and abuse it.  While the US government is based on religious beliefs, it also believes in allowing people personal freedom.  Most places in the States have banned smoking in close quarters (ie restaurants) and public drunkeness.

3971195_0	Pit bulls are a lot of things - loyal, friendly, active - but they're not naturally aggressive toward people. Since they were bred to fight other animals, it was important that they not snap at their human handlers. You've fallen for a common myth.
3971195_1	People like you are the reason dogs get banned.  I feel sorry for your dog.
3971195_2	It's owners like YOU that give pitbulls such a horrible rep.  It's people like YOU that cause law makers to ban pitbulls in almost every state.  It's because YOU and owners like you, that cause people to be scared of pits.

3971195_7	FU.CK YOU. your the reason why this good breed is band
3971195_8	Why would you want him aggressive?  Just train him to alert (bark) at strange noises. They carry enough of a bad rap as it is.... most of the time a barking dog is enough to deter someone from breaking in.
3971195_9	He is only one year old so he is still a puppy.. When intruders broke in he was probably terrified the poor love.. . I think you should consider yourself very lucky that you have such a normal puppy.. . Please do not feel the need to make him agressive, you will be glad in the long run. When you can walk down the pavement without him ripping some yorkshire terriers head off.. . Also it will save you in vet fees,. . Love him and he will love you which surely is why you got the puppy in the first place, if nit then perhaps you need to reconsider why you have him.
3971195_10	pits are not naturally good guard dogs but they can be trained. if you want this dog just for fighting though YOU should be put to sleep.

3971195_13	If this is a dog is in a neighborhood setting, I suggest weighing the cons posed by having a dog that is aggressive.  One bite and you could be looking at law suit city.  Even if the bite occurs while someone is breaking in, you could be liable for a dangerous dog.. . Good for your dog to have self preservation and to hide.  Smart dog!!!  Robbers usually know if there is a dog there and will come prepared to eliminate any threat posed by the dog (ie they neutralize the dog with mace, bludgeoning, etc.) or trick it into one room with food and lock it in there and still take your stuff.  I know you want to protect your stuff but you are much better off having a better alarm system or locks or living in a safer part of town.. . Most 1 year old dogs are not mentally mature enough to be guard dogs without professional training.  They gain confidence about their territory and protecting it in the years to come.
3971195_14	Trying to make him more aggressive is why pits have such a bad name.  Talk to a trainer about some protection/guard dog training.  They should be trained by a professional and not you.  You need to go with him when he is trained and learn how to control him afterward.. Good luck
3971195_15	I really hope you don't want an aggressive dog.  I am sure you have a loyal dog and had you been there and he felt your life was in danger or you were hit he would have defended you even if it was to his death.  I am sure that is what you want.  Once a dog is trained to be aggressive he is not safe to be around.  My sister had bull dogs and thought they should be aggressive and thought it was funny that everyone was scared of them.  She fell and broke her hip and then her dogs were not safe around her as they know they could overpower her.  After one of the 5 attacked her she had to give them to a bull dog rescue.
3971195_16	Herbs, your head must be a little under the influence of HERB... Why not getting an alarm system instead?  You're asking for trouble.  It's so sad when you go to a local animal shelter, and find out that most of the dogs in death row are pits.  If only people knew what they're getting into before they make such a commitment.  Owners shouldn't have dogs if they get them for the wrong reasons.  Later on they find out that having an aggressive dog is more a liability than an asset.  Don't do harm to this dog, you don't need that, trust me.  In the long term, it's more rewarding to have a loyal and loving dog, than a dog that will bring you nothing but trouble and inconveniences.
3971195_17	Why would you want to make him more agressive? I hope you don't have kids. But, on the other hand to make him more protective or assertive over his domain you should give him something to be protective over. Maybe a toy or something your dog can lay claim to. Eventually this instinct will mature and make him behave more as an alpha dog in his domain. But by making him agressiv... it could cause problems for you and or your family down the road.
3971195_18	you are the type person I would like to choke!!!! you are the reason this breed has a bad name !!!!!! if he is loved and properly taken care of he will protect his house out of loyalty....he may never do more than bark but this will make someone think twice before entering....I had a rescue that we saved from a life of being used as a puppy machine for fighting dogs and she went thru a window to keep an intruder from breaking in...she didnt have an aggressive bone in her body......dont try to ruin a beautiful temperment out of stupidity!!!! give him a chance to grow up .
3971195_19	Get another dog. I have a red nose gentle pit and he's a good guard dog yet he's soo sweet. Pitts have a bad reputation and if agressive they could turn on there owners. You don't want a mean pit! He could be too agressive and out of control and thats not what you want. Try getting another dog! It's not your pits fault he's a lover not a fighter! Think twice about making him mean! Once he locks his jaws there locked!!!! Be careful, My pitt has a sister not with us but she is mean like Cujo!
3971195_20	pay a stranger to come over & let him self in ur house & scare the dog every couple days, have him chase the dog around, then run out the door & have him act scared & run from the dog when the dog  starts to react to his intrusions in a week or so, he will be less likely to even get in the door, & U should reward ur dog, after waiting a short time before U return home each time & he will learn to hate intruders.
3971195_21	APBT's DO NOT lock tehir jaws.  Thats is one of the most common falsehoods on this breed.  I show in ADBA conformation shows an weight pulls.  These dogs were not bred an are not inheritently a human agressive beed an it gripes me to see people who try to make a manbiter.  TRUE apbt's are not liek that at all.  Now if yiu are talking about 100lb Razors Edge or Gotti types then yes they may bite. Anyone who knows the history on these dogs knows that those are not true to type bulldogs.  :-)
3971195_22	You dont want him to be aggressive, because say instead of someone breaking into your house there is a kid playing in your front yard and the dog attacks... Now come on would you rather have a dog that is friendly or one that is going to attack a 2 year old child????
3971195_23	i don't know it might just be his nature to be friendly. Why don't you be ahppy with the one you have.
3971195_24	There are alot of thing you can do to make your Pit Bull aggressive. But why, why would you want to do that??!! That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. So your dog runs away when people break into your house. I rather have my dog run out of the house then it try and attack someone and then end up getting shot and dieing.. . You don't need your dog to be aggressive, so don't try too. It's so very wrong.
3971195_25	Put "Beware of Dog" signs up. Train him to bark at unusual noises. But don't try him to get too aggressive.
3971195_26	The majority of responses are on the "mark".  You don't want him/her more aggressive, you want it to protect your house.  You must create a bond with your dog, as Pit Bulls make it their life's mission to please their owner.  Understand that all Pit Bulls do not bark.  But if you create a close enough bond with your animal they will not welcome in an intruder.  They will show their teeth, growl and run an intruder away (without biting), they will corner (without biting) an intruder in your house and not allow them to leave until you get there.  An ideal Pit Bull will not do more than that, but are certainly effective.  You don't want a "maneater"!. . Creat the bond, forget aggressiveness and more importantly read up on the breed.  Unfortunately, too many people acquire Pit Bulls without truly understanding the breed itself.  They are the most loving, entertaining, loyal and respectful animals that I have had the pleasure of raising.. . Good luck to you and your dog.
3971195_27	let ur dog be how he wants to be....if he wants to run let him, maybe ur the one who should be guarding ur own house. lol. i have a pit and he is sooo nice. he loves people, dogs, cats and everything else. but he get afraid when it comes to big crowds of people. and hte only time he barks is at night. so let him be what he wants to be

The downcycle now started in CA, Wash DC, NYC, Vegas and other hot areas of the past are all soft and getting softer.. . From 1990 to 1996, the average home in San Diego lost 20% of its' value! The cycle we are now enterng looks like it could well exceed that on the downside!. . With all the 100% financing, interest only loans, EZ qualifing etc...even a slight decline will cause many to be unable to sell for the amount due on their loans!. .

2655264_3	To me, taking Christ out of Christmas is like taking the menorah out of Hanukkah.  To say that they can't be called Christmas Trees any more (but must be Holiday Trees instead) is just as insulting as someone calling a menorah a candle-holder.. . I was very glad to see that it's still being called Christmas In Rockefeller Center last night.  If it had been Happy Holidays In Rockefeller Center, I would have thrown a fit.  . . I think, if it is a Christmas Festival, people should definitely be allowed to call it that.  If you're not Christian, you really have no business being at a Christmas Festival.  If you prefer a Holiday Festival, whatever, but if they are choosing to call it a Christmas Festival, then it should be about CHRISTMAS and not trying to make people of all religions happy.. . It's only a matter of time before Easter gets attacked too... well, you already see big pink bunnies all over the place... OK, never mind.  Easter has already lost its Christian meaning.  You never see signs that say Resurrection Sale Extravaganza, just as we're seeing far less signs that say Christmas Extravaganza.  Pretty soon, Easter is going to melt into the HOLIDAY pile of mush.. . When it does, I think the world will be much worse off.  Just as we are now, with Christmas becoming just another Holiday.
4308477_0	According to unverified informations, there is a Document called 'Protocals', perhaps of ZionistChristians andJews. Their long term planning was stated to be  defacing all Muslim countries by 1910, in order to let 'prophesies' fulfill! So one and the other excuse was coined to attack and subdue one by one all the countries with some Musliminfluence. Apparently now,  Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, and Afghans had no means to attack any western country. Yet the war goes on. The cause may be religious, not oil. No oil in Afghanistan. However this answer is based on hearsay,on conjectures. May be a food for thoughts!
4308477_2	Cause? Bush said(quote) Iraq had something to do with 9/11.
4308477_3	Apparently Bush was thinking that there were Weapons of Mass Destruction over in Iraq and they were pointed at him, so he saw fit to send our service men and women over there to die over a bit of misinformation.  9/11 had to do with Afganistan.

3352978_3	There are at least two professional wart removal products OTC these days, that work like getting them frozen off in the Dr.'s office. Dr. Scholl's Freeze Away and Wartner Wart Removal System are both available at local drug stores and supercenters.  Follow the instructions carefully, as this product can burn the skin badly. Another home remedy is good ol' duct tape, applied directly to the wart.. . Like prescription treatments, over-the-counter treatments usually require multiple applications, and are only necessary if the warts are problematic. Additionally, these treatments are capable of destroying healthy skin as well as warts, so caution must be exercised by those attempting them without medical supervision.

1269055_1	Cut down on your portions and eat more small meals throughout the day.  Exercise at least 20 minutes a day 3 times a week.  Other than that you just need to give it time.  It can take a couple of weeks before you start to notice a weight loss.  Keep in mind - that from the exercise you're toning up and developing muscle.  Muscle weighs more than fat but is compact.  So you may actually gain weight but trim down if that makes any sense.  Don't give up - lots of luck!!!

The Virginia and New Jersey plans were used to establish rules of elected House Representatives and US Senators.  The US subscribed to the Virginia Plan on how it would elect congressional representatives which was by population.  The New Jersey Plan was used to elect Senators--two per state, completely opposite of the Virginia Plan.

Put the chops back in the skillet and add the chopped onion and 3 to 4 cloves of chopped garlic to pot with 1/4 cup of water. Put a lid on the pot and steam the chops for approximately 20 minutes.. . Collard greens: . 2 bunches collards . 3 smoked ham hocks . 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening . Salt and red pepper, to taste. . Remove the stems, cut up and wash the collard greens.

1324444_6	I have 2 Amazon Parrots for many years..  First of all, never feed any parrot chocolate or avocado , it's the same as poison.  Their diet has to range from bird seed to meats, & everything in between.  They love all meats, rice & potatoes.  Fruits of all kinds.  They have to be placed in clean feeding cups along side clean water daily.  You mentioned "How"to feed a parrot, see above feeding cups, or if they will not eat out of cups, because they are young or new sorroundings, feed tuna pieces by hand. Never make the mistake of only birdseed or parrot feed, they need a varied diet. They even love Coke or Pepsi as a treat.  Hope this helps.

Then, rather than dumping fish in from the bag, use a net and get them out and add to tank.  Dispose of water in bag because you don't want to introduce other water (from pet store) into tank.

4401156_14	You can do it the cheapo way - mail a copy to yourself with the post mark proving that you wrote the story before that particular date. (Keeping it sealed on the off chance it came up in court.). Or you can file for a copyright - www.copyright.gov/forms. Which will cost you. (Which I don't recommend unless you are about to get it published.) In either case, if you are going to send in a story for publishing, don't write 'Copyright, 2006 Bill Johnson'. (This is extremely tacky and editors will laugh at you. Off to the slush pile with it.). People tend to go over board with the copyright thing. There really aren't that many people who are going to steal your story. Potentially it could happen, but a lot of the 'YOU MUST GET A COPYRIGHT' is paranoia. . Legally speaking, the minute you finished writing your story, you have a copyright on it. As long as you have a witness you'd be fine.. People are too obsessed with intellectual property. Don't worry about it.

You can open a business and hire mechanics to repair small airplanes which is a growing sector,it is easier to avoid taxes as a business than as a worker.Perhaps you can fly the plane across the border to get it repaired then fly back like visiting a dentist for cheaper treatment.. . Education and training is touted as a way to increase pay but other countries can bid your wages down to their level and make your investment worthless.Workers in America elect politicians on cultural issues like abortion but when in office they enact economic deregulation and never get around to the cultural stuff.

4246221_15	your pub sound,s crap.but soon all pub,s will ban smoking,but i dought they will ban drinking.at least i hope not!
4246221_16	I think they are allowed to drink in pubs...unless the bar man decides the person has had enough and it would be incompetent of him to serve any more alcohol.. . As for the smoking....Its considered to be anti-social to some people and being a carcinogenic and passive smoking proven, why should the health of a non smoker be put at risk because of someones selfishness to polute their body?. If it was only their body they were poluting then fine...but as it's not.....it's banned in enclosed spaces.
4246221_30	I think the laws have become extreme and although I can see why they are there to prevent passive-smoking, they inhibit people's freedom at the same time.. . There is so much campaign out there to stop people from smoking full stop and not just in pubs but at the workplace too.  I guess this is good when fires can be started from not puting out a cigarrette and that makes sense.  . . But if they are going to ban smoking they may as well ban drinking when there so many accidents on the roads relating to drink.  . . They may as well ban anything that is seen as a threat to human life itself because the way we are going, we are going to be dead anyway from all of the pollution and global warming! - so, yes, I think that banning smoking is ridiculous when governments won't fork out money they tax us, to stop the effects of global warming. . . Instead they tax us more for the problems that they have created!

But sms is annoying and people just delete the messages plus it costs them to reply, which they don't like unless it a speecific product.

4473137_0	You cannot be referring to modern day - the Christian church, including the catholic church is actually shrinking and losing members!!!. . Probably because of all the extremist religious views expressed by a small number that pick on anyone who does not share their belief.
4473137_1	In my opinion millions of inncocent people have died because of this religion several civilizations including the Aztec and the Incas where destroyed by Christanity. It has had a bad affect on the world!
4473137_2	Corruption - Christian sprang up as the religion on o fthe poor, rich people 'sanitized it' to control the poor with things such as it is easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for the rich to enter the kingdom of god.  Thereby, ensuring the poor has some justification or maybe some light at the end of the tunnel of poverty.
4473137_3	Cause - God's intervention into human history. Effect - sin is conquered.
973859_3	You cannot determine where on your body you will lose weight, the best you can do is to lower your bodyfat levels.  For the average person, the fat stored around the waist is the hardest to get rid of, you need to get your bodyfat under 20% to get a slim waist, and under 10% to show the stomach muscles.. . To lose body-fat exercise regularly and start calorie counting. Work out your BMR and try to eat about 500 calories a day less than this.. . Running is one of the best ways to lose weight, cycling, swimming, rowing are also very good. If your not comfortable with these try dancing to your favorite music in your bedroom for an hour a day.. . Don't try to lose weight it too quickly, 2 pounds a week maximum.

1083701_2	The importance of learning Asian history is so important, that no one would dare to laugh. Only a fool and idiot would do such a thing. That kind of history is very rich, long, and powerful. The Asians were clever in their inventions. Without them, there would be no paper, chopsticks, or printing presses. They have had many languages, music, and hardships because the rest of the world has shunned them. So see that you don't underestimate the Asians.

587884_5	Have you ever seen body builders in their off-season....all big bulky back and arms, huge ripped legs and a fat gut....this is because the body tends to store fat in the abdominal region first and it does so relatively easy too.. I am assuming that you are a slim person with some belly fat then it should be easier for  you to lose your fat with proper diet and cardio vascular exercise (burning more calories than you take in).. Crunches, leg lifts, sit ups etc will not get rid of the fat but will tone and strengthen the underlying muscles while you burn the fat off with cardio.. . Forget that digestion claim about the belly fat.. . Exercise and proper diet incorporated into your lifestyle will get rid of that belly fat and keep it off!!!
1477322_0	Because most people who have those view are most closet racists.They like to pick on Germans because they think it's alright to,but it's not. They need to get over what is now history and concentrate on what is happening in the world today.I love Germans.
1477322_1	The fact that your young men went backpacking across Europe in the late 30s and early 40s trying to snuff out those not fit to live with the "Master Race" will probably have to still take a couple more centuries to fade from Human memory.
1477322_2	maybe its because the nazis were german i guess
1477322_3	The Nazi's gave Germans and Aryans a bad name
1477322_4	because of way back when...Hitler was in charge.  this is so stereotyping and not cool.  Even if they were, so are others in their own way.
1477322_5	because the apple doesen't fall far from the tree.
1477322_6	They got that Hitler and the Nazi's crap hanging over their heads. Their all being profiled for the actions of past German men who were in positions of power over their country, who committed vile and unforgivable acts for the sake of their own personal agendas. It's a damn shame German folks today have to be associated with that. Kinda like the myth of Adam and Eve, and we humans today have to  have sin hanging over heads, for something THEY did.
1477322_7	the roots of the nazi party would be a reason. I've never heard of this though.
4458783_6	If you are confused in trying to understand the contents of the Bible, may I suggest in reading other holy or sacred books (for example, the English translation of the Holy Quran).. . I have met and heard people who cannot find answer or explanation in the Bible, but can find answer to their questions in the Holy Quran. Nowadays there are several good translation in English of the Holy Quran.. . Despite the differences in the teaching of Islam and Christians, there are some similarities. To Muslims, Islam is the completion of the teaching of Jesus. That is why some may find the answer to the question they are seeking in the Bible but cannot find it, they find it in the Quran.. . Some similarities in Islam:. 1. Islam teaches it's followers to believe that Jesus really exist and Jesus is the messenger of God.. . 2. Muslims believe in the story of Adam and Eve (but with different understanding. For example, Muslims believe human beings do not carry the burden of the sin committed by Adam & Eve. In fact Muslims do not consider that Adam had committed sin by eating the apple. He was actually tricked by Satan. Hence, he did not intentionally want to eat the forbidden fruit). . 3. Muslims believe in end of the worlds; in the existence of heaven and hell.. . 4. Muslims believe that Jesus will come back to earth near the end of the world.. . So, why not try reading the Holy Quran to find out Islam version to your questions.
4458783_12	By their fruits you shall know them. Take The book of Revelations for example. When John said he saw a Dragon, it wasn't literally a true dragon. He used attributes of the dragons appearance and behavior to relate to the Antichrist, who definitely isn't a Dragon but a Human.
354733_0	The following photographer's work stands up because they work with light and dark and color and texture to produce amazing images.  From the meticulous detail of an Ansel Adams landscape to the grainy edginess of an Annie Leibovitz portrait, each master photographer also has their own style and composition but the common basis is the level of quality and creativity they each bring to their work.
354733_1	Look around on this site, maybe it'll help:. . http://www.masters-of-photography.com/
354733_2	Ansel Adams and Clyde Butcher are the 2 I admire most.  I can't pinpoint one thing about their work, but it makes you feel something.. The link is to one of my friends, his work can be bought at a much lower price than the other two listed above.
354733_3	Lewis Hines... because of his provaocative photos in the early 1900's of young children performing difficult (and often dangerous and deadly) jobs, child labor laws were enacted.  Hines was a reporter, and his photos got the truth out about young children doing hard labor for small wages.  I have a book about this awesome guy, but here is a website about him. Some of the photos are the same ones as in the book.. . http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/childlabor/index.html
354733_4	Ansel Adams for one.. Yousef Karsh another.. . Both these men took portraits, Adams chose to photograph nature, particularly in and around Yosemite and Karsh photographed the powerful people that influenced the world. . . Why do their images stand the test of time? In my humble opinion because of their simplicity.
354733_5	Gregory Crewdson. Each photo seems like it tells so much. They look like a scene from a movie, making you guess what's happening and keeps you drawn in wondering what the people in the photos are doing.
354733_6	Josef Sudek - because he mastered the art and took extraordinary pictures of ordinary scenes and objects. Sorry I cannot be more specific, as it would take a very long time to describe all of the reasons. Google him
354733_7	All the photographers mentioned here are excellent and I would pick all of them as well.  One great master, however, is missing - Yousuf Karsh.  Karsh was a Canadian portraitist whose subjects included just about every famous person from 1940 forward.  Heads of state, movie stars, artists (Ansel Adams among them), great leaders many were Karshed.  Many of his portraits graced the cover of Life Magazine.. http://www.eastman.org/ne/mismi3/karsh_sld00001.html. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:YousufKarsh.jpg. http://masters-of-photography.com/K/karsh/karsh.html. http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/karsh_yousuf.html

1782359_4	if you are anxious to the point that it interferes with your everyday functioning, that is usually clinical anxiety. only a  professional can diagnose you for sure. It all depends on how much your anxiety keeps you from your normal routine. Fortunately, anxiety is very easy to treat. panic attacks are different from generalized anxiety disorder. If your anxiety is related to a specific issue, such as your health, that is not generalized anxiety. That would be more situational anxiety. Also, depression and anxiety very frequently travel together.. I am a therapist, and recommend that you find a good therapist to talk to.. good luck
316449_1	Maybe because of the Africans constantly trying to get over to Italy (which lies quite close to Africa). They have constant problems with the Africans in this regard, and so this could cause some negative feelings to blacks (I don't know about racism to other peoples except maybe Arabs who are Muslim and this would be fore the same reason why so many other people don't like Muslims). Kind of like Americans and the Mexican-illegals. Its the same thing.
316449_3	just like some people in other races are racist

3714567_9	In the beginning it was coz they were no match for them and coz they worshipped "pagan deities".. But christianity kinda adopted some of it's practices.Constantine used christianity for political reasons.So "some christians" that didn't like Constantine's influence in christianity were killed and called heretics,apostates!

1838330_1	The addition of ethanol in gasoline fuel in small amounts (10%-ish) will boost the octane level of the gasoline while doing little to nothing to the efficiency. It is also proported to help the gasoline burn a little cleaner and reduce emissions.. The lastest thing is to use high percentage ethanol (85%). The fuel acts a little differently, so the car you use it in need to be capable of handling the different fuel charge. Generally, these high ethanol content fuels burn cleaner then the normal gasoline, but the heating value of the mix is lower, so you don't get as much energy out of the fuel (use more fuel). The jury is out as to whether the cost vs. fuel efficiency will work out favorably. Also some questions about availability of ethanol production and distributio

3396066_0	The air is much thinner at high altitudes, and the engines on long-range jets are designed to operate at their best efficency in thin air. Also, since the air is so much thinner at high altitude the resistance against the aircraft (drag) is much reduced, meaning they jet burns less fuel for the same effect. This translates into much better fuel economy, leaving more money per mile for the airline. Also, airliners cruise at different altitudes with a minimum 500' of separation. This makes for a lot of different "lanes" for them to use, and makes it safer for many planes to be in the air at the same time, reducing the chance of collision.
3396066_1	At higher altitude the air is thinner and there is less drag on the airframe, the engines also consume vastly less fuel. As the air gets colder the engines run more efficiently until you get to about 36,000 feet where the air stops cooling down. There's also a change over between your ground speed being limited by indicated air speed and mach number. Below that height, somewhere around 28,000 feet, as you climb at constant air speed your ground speed inscrease, above that height as you climb at constant mach number your ground speed decreases... and so does your indicated air speed which ultimately limits your altitude as your indicated air speed at maximum mach number starts to approach your minimum air speed without high lift devices.. . Passanger comfort and avoiding weather are important, but efficiency is king, that's why 747s were capable of M0.92 but more modern jets tend to cruise at M0.8 and max out at M0.875 or below. They can't back off the mach number much without reducing their ability to reach the most effieient cruising altitudes.
3396066_2	The air is thinner. hence the flight will be smoother. A lot of times, the low altitude flights are bumpy...Some planes are up there to track, so they need to be high as possible to get the photos needed.
3396066_3	The primary reason is to fly above the weather that would be encountered en route at lower levels. Passenger comfort, safety, separation from other aircraft, & depending on direction of flight, to take advantage of the higher wind speeds that are available at the higher altitudes.
3396066_4	less turbluence, smoother, above all the clouds and storms.
3396066_5	Number one, the higher you go, the smoother the air is.  It is also because the higher you go, you cover more distance because the arc of assent and descent covers greater distance.  There is less structural stress on an airplane at a higher altitude.  The temperature is very cold, so jet engines perform better and more efficiently.  Finally, the higher you go, the less congested the air space is.
3396066_6	I think the reason is planes can go faster at high altitudes due to the air been thinner. I think its called the slipstrem
3396066_7	so people don't look into the windows
3396066_8	Jet engines are DESIGNED to fly at high altitudes.  They get better economy.  A jet aircraft needs to get altitude as quickly as possible.   And second, the air is less turbulent and therefore a smoother ride.    Pops
3396066_9	two reasons:. . 1) better fuel economy. 2) higher airspeed
3396066_10	Aircraft need at least 1,000 feet separation to keep them from a risk of collision. Also, at high altitudes, aircraft can avoid bad weather from below (e.g. storms).
3396066_11	As a space shuttle pilot, I personally think that airplanes fly pretty darned low! Just kidding. Yeah, it's all about smooth air and the fact that jet engines operate much more efficiently at high altitudes where the air is thinner.
3396066_12	yeah, the air is thinner up there so there is less air resistence and the plane is more fuel efficiant

953210_2	First of all, entropy is a relative term and is not absolute. So, we can't measure entropy but only change in entropy can be measured. It is a measure of disorder. If the disorder is decreased, then we can have a negative entropy change. Disorder decreases with a decrease in tempearture. But if we consider the whole universe, though there is a decrease in temperature at one particular point, there will be increase in temperature at other points. So, you will always see a positive change in entropy. According to third law of thermodynamics, change in entropy would be zero only at absolute temperature. And we can not attain absolute zero temperature as there would be temperature corresponding to zero point energy associated with the atoms. That is the reason why we can attain hundredth of a Kelvin but not absolute zero. In order for the change in entropy to be negative, you have to go below absolute zero which is not possible. At absolute zero, atoms won't move which means that everything is ordered and the change in entropy is zero.

20376_0	The speedometers tell you how fast you are going. This way, you know by how much you are speeding. The related question raised by another answerer is a great question too: Why does the government permit companies to sell civilians (non racetrack / non emergency services) cars that go faster than is permissible by law ? If it is a crime to drive any faster, then my not rig the cars so you cannot go faster than is legal ?. Apart from medical emergencies and visits to racetracks, the only three answers I can think of is In Case You visit Germany with thei car; in case the law changes to permit speeding; or TO ALLOW THE STATE TO TAX US through giving out these BLEEDING %$£%^&*$£ speeding tickets.. . So overall, it would make more sense to rig cars so you could just floor it and still not be speeding (if this were achievable). . . And similarly, your suggestion that we also rig the speedometers on future cars to go no higher than the maximum legal speed on motorways is also a good one - this way boy racers might be put off and forgetful people would know for sure when they are going too fast.
20376_10	If you want a car which tops out at 70mph the closest you will get is a Chevolet Matiz.. . So go get one of them!. . Seriously, no no will buy a car which limits their speed to that. Or do you want a car which can go faster than 70mph but the dial only goes that far?
2676616_13	Over 1000 years before there was a Mexican, which is a mix between European Spaniards and Native Indians.  You don't know much about history, do you?
3937630_3	Because Traditionally, Witches are portrayed as villians in folk lore and fairytales.  Take any three "Old World" fairytales and you will see what i mean.  This even goes back to the early days of film and particularly animation.  In many of the early Disney movies (based on fairytales) witches are the villians.  This includes "Sleeping Beauty", "Snow White" and even later movies like "Little Mermaid".. . But this stigma (In film) probally goes back to the 1600s and the witch scares in America and England (If you think the Salem Witch Trials were bad you shouls look into what was happening in England).  This was a time that little was known about Wiccan beliefs, and the Holier then thou mindframe of the time.  It was believed at the time (and some believe now) that witches were in leauge with the devil.. . And people seem to forget that "The Wizard of Oz" features the most beloved witch of all time... Galinda.  (I might have spelled it wrong)
3526149_7	Could it be a reaction to the fact that muslims are always trying to blow us up, and jews and hindus are`nt.
3526149_16	I have seen intolerably racist questions targeting Islam and Muslims but YA seems to tolerate the intolerable. But I am not in the least surprised.  Hate papers about Islam and its religious figures are nowadays defended and encouraged in the name of freedom of speech, while issues related to important phases in the history of Jews, for example, may not be discussed under the law.

So, the short answer is that we can stop visible light actually, for example by shining a beam of light onto a black background where it will be stopped (black absorbes visible light). But what actually happens is the black surface re-radiates the energy in different wave lengths to that in which it was absorbed .. So can you stop light - yes - can you stop radiation in general - no.
2018562_0	He wants to be a police dog.!
2018562_1	Some dogs howl habitually at noises that are unusual to them.  My black lab used to howl at police sirens - not fire trucks, mind you, just police sirens.  Other than that, he was quiet as a mouse. Even coyotes howling couldn't get him started. . . One expert says, if your dog howls during music, he's just sining along, showing he's part of the "pack".
2018562_2	I have a Black Lab too, they can not be figured out, my dog surprises me every day with his intelligence and great personality. I think it's really funny that he picked Law and Order to haul too, hilarious. Try singing to him and see what happens, my dogs all howl when I sing..
2018562_3	I don't have any idea how that song goes, but maybe he associates the song with siren sounds. Dogs have very sensitive ears, as you know. A siren sound literally hurts their ears, because they are very sensitive to sounds. A lot of dogs start howling whenever they hear it, because it's a very high-pitched sound.
2018562_4	Because it is the only way he can release the inevitable tension caused by the "dum dum"s as the show progresses.. . Come on, you know we're all on the edge of our seats everytime we hear that sound. You're dog is just a huge fan. :)
2018562_5	Either he likes the sound or it's hurting his ears.
2018562_6	You should do a science project with him.  Play him the theme songs from these shows:  . . NYPD Blue. L.A. Law. Hunter. The Commish. NewsRadio. Blossom. Hill Street Blues. The A-Team. The Greatest American Hero. Magnum, P.I.. Doogie Howser, M.D.. Quantum Leap. Remington Steele. Renegade. Silk Stalkings. Wise Guy. . See how he reacts to each of theme.  Perhaps he's just really into the musical compositions of Mike Post.
2018562_7	Isn't there a siren in there somewhere, maybe towards the end.  Maybe she howls first before the other dogs, or what she thinks are dogs,  at the end.
2018562_8	My cocker spaniel did this too, to the opening theme song to The Young and the Restless when I was growing up. It was only the intro song, but not the closing theme song, which sounded the same to me. Are we being warned by our faithful pets of subliminals?

269079_10	That depends on what you mean by slavery. Slavery in NT times is very different from the slavery we hear about that caused the civil war in America. Slavery in NT times is pretty much the same as having maids in Singapore, it is voluntary and a form of gainful employment. Sometimes abuses take place, but by and large it is not oppressive or tyrannical as an institution.

2720201_4	The only reasons I know of deal with safety issues.  However, when I was in Wyoming, we saw a female moose along the road in a stream.  I didn't have my shoes on.  I wanted to get out of the car, run, across the street and take a picture, but I had to stop and put my shoes on before getting out.  By that time, several other cars stopped, and she moved off.  I got a decent photo, but not as good as if I had gotten out more quickly.  The bottom line... you never know when you might need to get out of the car and move in a hurry, for safety and fun/interesting reasons.

3415293_8	When Jesus died on the cross for our sins, He not only died for the sins of the Jews, but for the sins of the Gentiles as well. Those who accept Jesus as their Savior and are born again, are adopted into God's family and become His children. This is for all the Jews as well as Gentiles.  IF you were not a Jew then you were a Gentile.. . The name Christian means to be Christ like. To walk as He walked and try to follow His example to the best that we can. When we fall short of the glory of God, we repent of our sins, which is what we are do to daily.
1512185_0	Actually, there were three main reasons that they (and MOST pilots of the era) wore those leather helmets. 1- to keep their heads warm, the cockpits were not heated, so they wore lined leather helmets (and jackets and gloves). 2- to contain their earphones for communication. 3- to fasten their goggles and oxygen masks on. Many had an up-turned flap on the top where they also wore an emblem.
1512185_1	Dusty is closest, but pilots at that time mainly wore helmets to protect themselves from taking a hard bump to the head.  Flight, especially not at low altitudes and in combat conditions and in piston-engined planes, is not smooth.  And inexperienced pilots, as most of these guys were, were shakier than their more experienced (but mostly dead, by 1944) brethern.. . A hard bump could knock them out and make their Ultimate Sacrifice even less meaningful.
1512185_2	well eventhough they are suicide pilots as the term "Kamikaze" means, they are just to wear it before their suicide attempt and not die through accident :)

361651_5	Yes, I have found that by purchasing both body fat percentage scales (Tanita) and body fat callipers (Accu-Measure), you can get an accurate idea of your body fat percentage by cross-referencing the two readings. Using body fat callipers does take a little practice, but if you find the two readings are similar or the same, then you can be pretty sure that it is a fairly accurate measurement of your body fat percentage. Both of these items can be purchased through Ebay for reasonable prices. HTH : )

3085580_0	It's because when air gets hot it expands, and when it gets cold it contracts.  The cold air coming from the air conditioner is denser than the air that's already in the house, so it tends to sink.  If the AC vent were in the floor, the air higher up would never get cold, but with the vent in the ceiling, the cold air falls through the room and cools everything.  In the same manner, hot air rises, so having the vents in the floor makes the hot air float through the room instead of just staying on the ceiling and leaving the floor cold.
3085580_1	Hot air rises . Cool air falls . Sooooo I guess its to keep the  balance
3085580_2	Hot air is less dense and rises easily.. . Cold air is more dense and decends easily
3085580_4	Let's keep it simple; hot air rises, and cold air sinks. Hence, you have the cold air released near the ceiling, and it flows down through the room, and the warm air released near the floor to flow up into the room. It's for a more even dispersement of the 'conditioned' air.

Witch hazel should work pretty darn well. Just remember, when using an astringent, all your pimples will come to a head before it makes it easier to get rid of them. This could be slightly painful for large zits and it will make them temporarily look worse, so choose a time to use it where you don't have to go out in public much for a few days.

837150_0	No, because 0C is simply the freezing point of water.  It's an artificial zero point, picked because it's convenient for humans on Earth.  The absolute zero point (called, appropriately, absolute zero) is -273.15 C, or 273.15 degrees below the temperature water freezes.  Absolute zero has very specific thermodynamic properties - it is the temperature where atoms have the minimum molecular vibration, which defines heat.  It's too complicated to describe here - suggest you check the reference.. . Anyway, looking at temperatures from absolute zero, all temperatures are positive.  Also, every element (and compound) has its own thermodynamic characteristics, including melting point, boiling point, and freezing point.  So Fluorine has a boiling point that is 85.15 degrees above absolute zero, water has a boiling point that is 373.15 degrees above absolute zero, and iron (for example) has a boiling point that is 3134 degrees above absolute zero.. . Which simply means that on Earth, Florine in its natural state is always a gas.
837150_2	Most gases have negative boiling points (and melting points). zero degrees celsius isn't "absolute zero". It's just the point at which water freezes.. . Flourine freezes way below the freezing point of water, as does oxygen, carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, etc

2291272_3	Well... it depends on what you mean by it. Catholics are Christians, that's one of the meanings. But not all Christians are Catholics. So Catholicism isn't all of Christianity.. . As for semi-literacy on the roots of the Protestant Church... Protestants aren't the only non-Catolic Christians. Think Eastern Orthodox... And think the division of the Eastern and Western Roman Empire. No, Catholicism is not all of Christianity, by a long haul.
2291272_4	catholics practise their form of christianity. the bible condems the use of Idols, the veneration of mary,. the pomp and ceremony practised. .  REV 18:4  And I heard another voice out of heaven say: “Get out of her, my people, if YOU do not want to share with her in her sins, and if YOU do not want to receive part of her plagues. 5 For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind. 6 Render to her even as she herself rendered, and do to her twice as much, yes, twice the number of the things she did; in the cup in which she put a mixture put twice as much of the mixture for her. 7 To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. For in her heart she keeps saying, ‘I sit a queen, and I am no widow, and I shall never see mourning.’ 8 That is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong.

2291272_6	Because not only do they have no basis to even exist as a Church, The Lord will destroy the Catholic Church during the tribulation for the reasons given in Revelations CH.17 V1-9
2291272_7	Protestants, in particular fundamentalists feel that they are the true christians, and that the Catholic church has perverted christianity into a bizarre polytheistic idol worshipping cult.  They forget, or usually don't know church history.. . Crash course in early christian history.... . Until 423 there was no "bible" or orthodoxy of belief....every little christian group, the Gnostics, Essenes and many others shared different views of who or what Jesus was, and used different versions of Gospels and letters.  . . Constantine ordered that the bishops make a catholic bible (ie broad in interest, appealing to the widest variety )  so they threw out the more contraversial and outrageous bits (and that's saying something !!!) edited and tried to correct inconsistencies with the included bits (and boy, did they miss a lot !!!!) came up with a canon, started persecuting heretic christians and building churches and forging relics with Constantines support.  Phew.. . As the Roman empire collapsed, what was now the Catholic church assumed a power vacuum in Rome and the pope became the de facto ruler of the former Roman Empire.  As literacy level dropped during the Dark Ages, and Latin fell out of common usage, the clergy were the only ones now with "direct access" to the word of god, and became incredibly powerful and rich as a result. (Remember, there was no TV back then, and a priest reading gods word to you in a language you didn't understand was a powerful thing). . The Protestant Reformation took place on several fronts with people like Calvin, Luther and Henry VIII reacting to the power and corruption of the papacy.   The Protestant movement has continued to fragment into even more faction ever since.. . However, by definition, they all worship Christ, whatever their docrtrinal differences, so they all practice Christianity.. . . The fact it is all delusion is an answer to a different question
2291272_8	They perform rituals, have graven images, lay up treasures on the earth,pray to saints worship idols,and pray to Mary.Just a few . things they do against The Word of God.I could go on and on.
2291272_9	Catholics are Christians. Some of their theology I disagree with but the basis is there and other Christians should recognize this.. . Romans 10:9 That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. 11 As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame." 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13 for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
2291272_10	Catholics trust in their good deeds to earn their way.. "How should I witness to someone who belongs to a denomination, who I suspect isn’t trusting the Savior?". . The most effective way to speak about the issues of eternity to a religious person is not to get sidetracked from the essentials of salvation. Upon hearing a person’s background, we may feel an obligation to speak to issues such as infant baptism, transubstantiation, etc. However, it is wise rather to build on the points of agreement between the Bible and the person’s denomination, such as the virgin birth, the cross, and so on. One point of agreement will almost certainly be the Ten Commandments. They are the key to bringing any religious person to a saving knowledge of the gospel. . . After someone is converted to Jesus Christ, the Bible will come alive and he will be led into all truth by the indwelling Holy Spirit. God’s Word will then give him light, and he will forsake religious tradition as he is led by God. While there are strong biblical arguments that may convince unregenerate people that their church’s traditions contradict Holy Scripture, there is a difficulty. Some religious people hold the teachings of their church to be on a par with, or of greater authority than, Holy Scripture. It is therefore often futile to try to convince them intellectually that their trust should be in the person of Jesus Christ, rather than in their own righteousness or in their church traditions. For this reason we should aim at the conscience, rather than the intellect. Take them through the Law of God (the Commandments) to show that they are condemned despite their works, and strongly emphasize that we are saved by grace, and grace alone, rather than by trusting in our own righteousness or religious traditions. . . If they are open to the gospel, and are interested in what God’s Word says in reference to their church’s teachings, they will listen to Scripture. For example, in Matthew 8:14 we see that Peter (whom the Roman Catholic church maintains was the first pope) was married, as were many of the other apostles (see 1 Corinthians 9:5).
2291272_11	Its a form of christianity... Get an education.
2291272_12	It is! Non-catholics just don't believe in having saints and having Mary as a mediator...or whatever mary is used for! But Catholics do seem to be very strong in their beliefs!
2291272_13	It is. The only way I can really perceive the divide being made is lack of education about the roots of the Protestant church.
2291272_14	aaaah it is, i dont understand how that gets all confused.
2291272_15	Catholics are Christians.  Some Protestants, attack Catholics and claim they are not true Christians because they worship Saints.  Catholics fulfill the requirement of being Christians by believing in one god and Jesus is the son of God.
2291272_16	Of course it is. It's only the semi literate fundmentalists who think it isn't. Ignore them, they are inconsequential

(Mat 15:11)  Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.. (Mat 15:12)  Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?. (Mat 15:13)  But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.. (Mat 15:14)  Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.. (Mat 15:15)  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.. (Mat 15:16)  And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?. (Mat 15:17)  Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?. (Mat 15:18)  But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.. (Mat 15:19)  For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:. Mat 15:20)  These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.

666238_1	Say you were charged with something punishable by 6 months in jail and you got 1 year probation.  If you commit an offense while on your 7th month of probation, you can still be held accountable and receive the original 6 months even though the sentence for the offense charged had expired.

3507491_1	all freedom is more important today to guard our rights as human beings.  We must protect our society
3507491_2	It always has been important.  It's no more important today than it ever has been.
3507491_3	What religious freedom.  You can't even talk about your religion in school or any State building in America. Once God is taken out of the picture in the US it will be like the fall of the Roman empire.  Don't let it happen folks  Go to www.stephen-knapp.com for the united relief network  and universal truths
3507491_4	Because you'll know the truth, and the truth will set you free!
3507491_5	'Cause there are so many fanatics who only want their opinion to count.
3507491_6	I think religious freedom has always been equally important because men are called to seek God according to their own heart and conscience...not under force. (Of course, God also calls us to seek him "in spirit and truth", rather than simply shaping Him into our own image of what we think He is....but our search for the one true path ought to never be one in which our freewill is taken away from us)
3507491_7	DECEPTION !! Satan works through deception..freedom of everything ..freedom is good when purpose is good / godly..otherwise , freedom in a sense against God's will ,it is deception ...a sin ...America leads the world in ensuring freedom of religion ...when the whole world rests in trust , then enforcement of religions occur as in the prophecy of Revelation 13....the enforcement of the 666 is none other but the opposite of religious freedom ..and who leads this time ? America !!! Deception today ? ...God Bless
3507491_8	It is time that religion is exposed for what it is. It is imaginary and made up by people, it is bogus
3507491_9	It is important in today's world because of the vast variety of cultures that now call the USA home. It is important to let people find their own way to enlightenment, without being pressured by the more dominant religions (which happens anyways). And then there is that small little thing we had to go through way back when, that if you disagreed with the "Church" you were burned or stoned to death. I think it is important that this does not happen in the US anymore and would like to think that it is because we have matured as a society. You'd think we have grown, but I am skeptical as the same thing happens behind closed doors so that instead of physical harm (most of time because there are always extremists who think they are above the law), mental harm is inflicted. So have we grown, or have we digressed...that is true question behind the supposed freedom of religion declaration.
3507491_10	Because this world is more pluralistic than in generations past and we're aware of that plurality faster due to things like television and the internet. We can see faraway parts of the world and learn about other cultures in the blink of an eye.. . In America, when the country was founded, it was just a handful of colonies who were essentially from the same countries, same race, same religion. They were fleeing religious persecution from their own religions. Now, over two hundred years later, America's much bigger with a lot more people coming here for those same freedoms.. . The right to religious freedom isn't restricted to the Christian religions of our founding fathers. They guaranteed that freedom for everyone, even if they couldn't possibly foresee how far that freedom would reach. There are more people, more nationalities and religions here than ever before, so it's even more important now to safeguard that right.. . If we don't, and we become a theocracy, all but 1% of the nation is going to have to either convert, leave, or risk being arrested or worse. I don't know about you, but I'd rather take an imperfect system and be able to improve upon it than fear for my life because I didn't convert to the religion my government told me to.
3507491_11	Religious Freedom is the canary in the mineshaft, it detects those who would trample ALL our freedoms, such as Islamists. No other modern form of government but Communists and Islamists care what religion anybody is, and both seek to control not only the body but also the mind of it's subjects.. It was Protestants who invented the Idea of Individual Religious Freedom, as opposed to princes or priests determining the content of our minds.. The other freedoms are corollaries of this central theorem, that we are free to think what we like: Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press, Freedom of Assembly, are all owed to Freedom of Religion.
3507491_12	God even gives us a choice.
3507491_13	my opinion it has always been important.  Today we have a war that is being depicted as based on religion so it is important from the stand point that it would be illegal to round up all the Muslims like they did to the Japanese Americans in WW2.. . For Christians I believe it is not good to live where there is religious freedom. I was in Europe during the cold war.  In hungary we had misionaries.  The people there who were christians were like only a few Christians are here today.  They would not have met secretly and had the extremely high moral and oneness were it legal.  There you only became a Christian because you loved God and Jesus,  because doing so was life threatening.   Nobody became a christian to make their business more profitable or because their friends went to church.   Persecution is good for the church so encourage all those atheists.
3507491_14	this way no one will be put to death for their religious belief system or the lack of a religious belief system which has happened in the past.
3507491_15	More people are standing up for their personal beliefs.  And we're finding that more and more people do not share the same views as mainstream religions.
3507491_16	its been important since the founding of this nation...this is more political really cuz youre concentrating on freedom with this
3507491_17	I don't believe it is more important now than it was before. The difference is we now have the freedom to voice our opinions, speak freely about our religions and practice any religion we choose.  It is not a matter of religious freedom. It is a matter of personal freedom. People want the right to make their own decisions and not have it dictated to them.
3618486_0	Tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus (strep throat) has the possibility of damaging the heart and lungs.  It occurs through an immune reaction.  In the kidneys it is known as glomerulonephritis, and can be severe enough to require dialysis or kidney transplant.  The process affecting the heart is rheumatic fever, which can damage the heart valves.. . The Mayo Clinic has a clear and brief explanation at http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/strep-throat/DS00260

2852860_6	As a former ballet dancer, I highly recommend Winsor Pilates. Pilates strengthens your muscles, and keeps them slim, not bulky. Pilates was developed to help injured athletes recover, so it is very constructive. Just 20 minutes a day, twice a week, after a about a month or less, will leave you with a noticeable difference in your abs.

4101538_1	The leaded fuel contains Tetraethyle lead (TEL) in small quantities. The reason for using this is that the piston type engines, while running on the Gasolin, sometimes produce a knocking sound which is due to the premature ignition of fuel/air mixture - knocking the piston down while it was going up during a compression cycle. This causes severe damage to the engine parts and, also, the unearthly knocking sound.. . Lead, while emitted through the exhaust pipes, enters the environment and causes sever damage.. . Its use was thus banned and other anti-knocking materials were discovered.
2337810_0	Premature aging is mostly due to sun damage.  Black skin naturally blocks more of the suns damaging rays and Asians tend to avoid the sun.  Whites tend to like a tanned look and hence cause sun damage/aging to occur faster.

4453130_18	There are Christians in the Catholic churches and the other denominational / nondenominatinal churches.. . The One Church consists of every person born of God.  God looks at the honest heart, not so much the denomination of the Church.. . Jesus is the High Priest that He can save people anywhere in this world.  It is important that the True Gospel be preached to someone.  For how can one be saved unless the Good News is preached to that one.. . The True Gospel is that Jesus Christ the Lord is the Only Begotten Son of God, born of a virgin without sin nature.  That He overcame satan's temptations and was the Sinless Lamb of God for the remission of our sins and rose from the dead because He was with out sin and regained control of the keys to death & hell.  Death had reigned sins the fall of the first Adam.  Now Jesus has the keys to death & hell.. . The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus.

2008017_1	i like crispy fried chicken, with a side of honey, dip the chicken in the honey and eat. my 8 year old and i will sit down together and eat a whole fried chicken. so...i'm not a black person, why do i like fried chicken so much?
2008017_2	that's like saying why do white people like mcdonalds so much.

2008017_6	I always wondered that as well.
2008017_7	Do you really think the fact of being black makes them like fried chicken more than if they were white? I think this generalization is quite inadequate...any generalization, in fact.

2008017_10	I think that most people like fried chicken.  I'm white and I think your a racists.
2008017_11	Why do white people like it so much, you idiot? You could ask why PEOPLE like it so much, right? What the f#*@ is the difference? We are all the same in my eyes, so the question is inane and I would feel ashamed if I were you. Oh, by the way, I am sure someone like you will wonder: I'M A WHITE GUY. Eat that, why don't you?!
2008017_12	yea color has nothing to do with fried chicken its just so damn finger licking good with the oil and greese love fries and onion rings too deep fried and chicken tenders and breaded fish and breaded vegetables that are fried or shrimp so.... its just so good

1511991_6	The US is a  republic since we do not vote directly for our federal laws but rather vote for representatives who will determine the laws by which we live. We do not have a democracy which exists only in a few small places, I think in Vermont or New Hampshire where the voters actually vote on everything. . For the rest of us, even at local levels, we vote on the people who will decide for us.
213353_5	I'm interested in the personal ideas, views and opinions of people.  If I have a question about something factual, I will go to a search engine or database.  If I just want to know what randon people think about a question with no one answer, I'll ask it here.
1108496_8	Art is the end result of a process by an artist.  Photography is a medium that an artist may use to produce a work of art.  So photography is related to art by way of an artist (who is also a photographer) who produces works of art that are photos.
2853803_0	I avoid the problem by par-cooking the Apples. Cook your filling over medium heat until 130 degrees F. is reached in an uncovered pot and hold the temperature for 10 minutes. Cool and then add to your pie shell. The apples shrink in the pot,  you also concentrate the flavor since you cooked off some water and the pectin in the Apples will then gel in the baking to give nice firm yet tender Apples without all the juices bleeding out (and the bottom crust doesn't get as soggy).
2853803_4	Some apples cook down and get softer than others.  Apples that are firmer like Granny Smith or Red/Golden Delicious apples retain their shape better than soft apples like Macintosh or Rome.  That helps, I usually use a combination of a few different types and pile them high in the pan.  It usually keeps me from having a hollow pie!

2184493_0	Tinitus is caused by the blood vessles in your ear causing the ear sensory cillia to vibrate which in turn makes you think you are hearing a sound coming from the outside.  Most tinitus sufferers simply put on a masking sound - sometimes called white noise - that helps blot out the sound coming from inside their ears.  There is supposed to be a device that will transmit a sound that has the opposite wave characteristics from the one generated by the tinitus which will cause the person to not hear any sound - that is neither the tinitus sound nor a masking sound - as the sound transmitted by the device will cancel out the tinitus sound.  This is a better option but I don't think it has been technologically proven yet.
2192891_0	The brackets can be glued or cemented on, it's uncomfortable getting them and they hurt a lot adjusting to them for the first few days and when they are tightened but you get used to them so quickly it actually feel funny when they are off.  Plus you get to have a great straight smile : )
2192891_1	just got braces a couple months ago. As for how they get put on, I'm not 100% sure, but the spread your lips really far apart, and put this kinda weird stuff *you can't feel it* and stick the brackets on that *in case you don't know what brackets are, their almost box things that keep the wires on* they but some weird blue UV light over it for a long time *your lips get reaaaaly sore* and that solidifies the braces on. They then stick the wire in and close the brackets *at least on mine* As for if they hurt, my orthodontist said you could be sore for a couple days,but I wasn't. And you get used to them faster than you think they will.. . Don't be afraid!!!!. . P.S. These people who say it hurts a ton, or are really uncomfortable are lying!!!!
2192891_2	Yupp, before you go in, were LOTS of chapstick, they take this see-through thing, puts it in your mouth, it spreads your mouth WIDE OPEN, it feels like your jaws gonna break off!!! And they dry out your mouth COMPLETLY! and then they glue them on! PROCESS TAKES AT LEAST 2HRS
2192891_3	They cement the to your teeth and yes it does hurt!!!! . Believe me i had mine on for 3 yrs just got the off though GGOOD LUCK!
2192891_4	The brackets are cemented to your teeth. That doesn't hurt, but the wires do. It's worth it though.
2192891_5	They use a cement-like glue and put all the brackets on, then insert the wires. It did not hurt me getting them on, but my teeth were very sore and sensitive for about two or three days afterwards. The chains -- you'll probably get them later -- really hurt the first time too. I just got mine off, and that doesn't hurt either.. . Good luck... :)
2192891_6	I had braces for three years, and they didn't hurt.  Your teeth are shifting and sometimes that can cause headaches, but "hurt" is a strong word.  You will feel minor discomfort when they get tighten, but nothing too serious.  In fact, swolling a aspirn or taking a tylenol will help you, if you are uncomfortable. By the way, once you get your braces off, you will feel good about the entire process.  Your smile is worth it.
2192891_7	Dental cement, it hurts some but it's not like you got stabbed, it's kind of like a dull ache when the wires get tightened... It's not excruciating and it's totally worth it when it's over.  After you're teeth have been corrected they take pliers and just pop the braces off and sand down the connection point - sounds kind of barbaric but it's not really that bad... just think about having a beautiful straight smile for the rest of your life!
2192891_8	they are not that bad once you have them on. it takes a while, they have to cement them to your teeth, with brackets, wires. stuff also gets caught in them too. but you will like the outcome of you nice teeth. some of the wires can bug you and you have to take really good care of your teeth with them.
2192891_9	i don't think they differ. . . I had them for a year. They have like a container (made for your teeth) and they put glue on your teeth first to make them stay and then they push the container up and the braces are one they use a light to have the glue dry faster then they make the wire and they cut to fit your mouth and if something hurts just tell the orthodontist
2192891_10	I had braces for three years. It was about 10 yrs ago and they used medical grade cement, little drops to adhere the metal to your teeth. I don't remember if it hurt to have them put on, but the monthly adjustments felt like I was teething. It was kind of an anxious feeling. I had 4 teeth pulled prior to getting them on, headgear as a child, an extra year of braces due to moving out of state and TONS of "cranking." I would do it all over though because I used to never smile, and since then I get compliments all the time... . My point: You'll be ok. A smile is one of the best gifts you can give someone. It doesn't hurt that bad, but the whole time you know you have a cool day to look forward to.

521752_2	THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS--. . In thermodynamics, there are four laws of very general validity, and as such they do not depend on the details of the interactions or the systems being studied. Hence, they can be applied to systems about which one knows nothing other than the balance of energy and matter transfer. Examples of this include Einstein's prediction of spontaneous emission around the turn of the 20th century and current research into the thermodynamics of black holes.. . The four laws are:. . Zeroth law of thermodynamics, stating that thermodynamic equilibrium is an equivalence relation. . If two thermodynamic systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. . . First law of thermodynamics, about the conservation of energy . The increase in the energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by heating, minus the amount lost in the form of work done by the system on its surroundings. . . Second law of thermodynamics, about entropy . The total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over time, approaching a maximum value. . . Third law of thermodynamics, about absolute zero temperature . As a system asymptotically approaches absolute zero of temperature all processes virtually cease and the entropy of the system asymptotically approaches a minimum value. . . This law is more clearly stated as: "the entropy of a perfectly crystalline body at absolute zero temperature is zero."
2290758_0	to lose their points...... jk! i dont really know..... Do you? :)
2290758_1	People like to that becaouse they want to be recognise that they are the one knows the answer and the questions inthe first place.

2043756_27	Super unleaded has a higher octane rating, which actually relates to how smooth and clean the "burn" is if the fuel. Higher octane rating means improved burn, hence a little more power to the wheels.. . You can swap as much as you like between one and the other, chances are unless your engine is specifically tuned for super unleaded (97 to 98 Octane rating), you won't see much difference.. . There is now a new "breed" of super unleaded fuels, such as V Power from Shell, which is actually a vast improvemnt, and you will tell the difference, particulalry over the longer-term, in terms of engine efficiency etc. Slight improvements in economy and acceleration. . .

896987_4	Was this "hair holder" a hot curling iron?  Applying heat to most solids will cause them to expand.  Because of the brittle nature of a glass, UNEVEN heating will exert pressure on the cooler parts, and when it finally lets go... boom, it goes everywhere.  But some glasses are "poorly made" like that other aswerer said, and were cooled unevenly at the time of manufacture, when the the thing went from a molten liquid to a solid.  Such a glass may be under pressure always, so that when it breaks, it's going to go everywhere no matter what.
4311093_0	Because it's less dense. Temperature affects density. And the less dense a gas is, the lighter it becomes, so to speak. Therefore it rises over cold air.
4311093_1	Because the molecules are further apart, so they need more room.
4311093_2	as cold particles are heavier then hot ones (more CO2)
4311093_3	cos can u imagine what would happen if it didnt
4311093_4	lighter than cold air...
4311093_5	Well, let us think of a balloon, as our system.. he gas inside it has a random movement and. is less dense than the air outside our balloon.. . Let it free to move. The balloon flows upward. Why ??. . Well, as you know, the gravity force, acting downward,. results in a force from the bottom to the top, and the. balloon goes up !!  Over the superior face of the balloon. you have a great mass of air, acting upon it. But,. against it, under the inferior face of the balloon there. will act a bigger mass of air, that weights more. The. difference in weights results in a force upward.. And the balloon goes up.. . If there were no gravity force, there will be no forces. acting upon the balloon.. . The same happens with our hotter air surrounded. by the colder air. The random movement of the hotter. air - considered as a system - has no effect upon the. resulting force. And the colder air flows down, to the. place where the hotter air was before ( otherwise. a vacuum will be produced...what impels the colder. air to flow and fill that empty place ). I did not mention. here the action of winds or other atmospheric phenomena. just to make things easier.
4311093_6	When air is hot, the heat energy causes the molecules to move further apart and so the density of hot air is lower than that of colder air. the lower density results in it rising up.
4311093_7	It doesn't! . . As my old Physics teacher used to say (usually just after throwing something at us!).... . "Hot air rises *above cooler air*". . As has been said, it is because less dense gasses will rise above more dense gasses. So, since warm air is less dense than cold air it will rise above it until it finds air of the same density, at which point it stops rising.
4311093_8	PV=nRT. . as temperature rises - for a constant number of molecules and a constant pressure - the volume increases. A larger volume for the same number of molecules means lower density. Thus a pocket of hot air "floats" in the cold air - or rises up.
4311093_9	When a volume of air is heated its molecular motion increases and the molecules move further apart thus increasing the volume.. Therefore, there will be less molecules in an equal volume of the hot air than the original volume of cold air.. . The density (weight) of the hotter air will be less than that of the cold air - it therefore rises - convection currents.. . It is this principle that causes a hot air balloon to rise.. . In the atmosphere, the rising air is called a 'Thermal' which is used by gliders, hang-gliders and soaring birds to get the lift.. . This principle is also used in domestic heating where the convection currents circulate the warm air around a room.. . (Convection currents are also set up in liquids)

2020678_10	Because the Democrats have convinced a large portion of the American people that the Iraq war is a mistake, entered on false intelligence and that it took the concentration off of Afghanistan. they don't bother to tell the people that they saw the same intelligence and voted for the war they want all the blame to go to the Republicans. After 9/11 people were ready to go to war in Afghanistan but are not capable of comprehending that Iraq is a very important front in the war on terror.

422118_1	The theory behind absolute zero is that "All matter ceases to exist" The molecules or atomic structures break down. When this happens you no longer have matter. No matter means that you have nothing. To reach absolute zero you simply have to keep cooling the substance. Cooling in this phrase means removing all the energy as possible.
422118_2	Absolute zero is defined as the temperature at which all molecular motion ceases. More precisely though, it is when molecular motion reaches a minimum, because quantum effects guarantee there will still be a little bit of fuzziness in the position of the particles.. . Electrons, for example, do not collapse into the nucleus at absolute zero because they can only exist in certain well-defined, or quantized, energy levels.

4357460_0	4 inch exhaust on a 4 cylinder?!!! What an incredibly pointless way to try and improve performance on a 4 cyl. and it probably did more harm than good if indeed you could even find a 4 inch exhaust system for a 4 banger. Best take it to someone who knows even the tiniest bit about cars if you want to gain any kind of performance.
4357460_1	take off 2 wheels and the body.  then call it a motorcycle.  power to weight ratio will increase dramatically.

4357460_6	super charger or turbo charger. thes will increase hp but the turbo will use more gas. you can also buy  performance chips and tuners.
4357460_7	You could put a smaller exhaust on for better performance for one thing.  A 4" exhaust on a 4 cyl. will hurt performance. Even on a bigger engine it lets atmospheric pressure into the exhaust system.  I have a V8 and a 3" is pushing it.  A semi or a vehicle with a hell of a turbo might use a 4".  Other things you could try would be forced induction, headers, fuel injectors, bigger cam, new heads with bigger valves, new internally balanced crank with lightweight pistons and rods for more RPMs.  Possibilities are endless assuming you have the money.

4357460_14	i build performance cars for a living first of all get rid of the 4" exhaust not enough back pressure and u loose low end torque and for a four cyclinder horsepower is easy to make its torque thats hard that is why they are not fast. first let me recommend that if u want to go FAST go to ebay type drag car for ur search and watch what comes up it will be nothing but V8 chevy and ford they only true way to go fast. but if ur bent on ur mitsu thats fine but it would help to know ur budget and understand that i can go get a stock 97 or 98 mustang and spend about 1500 bucks and ur car without serious money in it like say around 7 to 8k will never get within 10 car lengths of that mustang. but if u have lets say 1 to 2k to spend here is what u do change ur exhaust to either a 2" or a 2and a half get ur low end grunt back then put a full length tube header on the car. then if budget still allows call up vex and order there fuel injection nitrous kit for 600 shipped install the kit with a 60 shot or 50 shot nothing more or u can damage the car then order up cam gears so u can retard the timing 2 degrees to compensate for the nitrous then do a tune up run a one stage colder spark plug and get a good set of wires and a good coil make sure ur spark is good then change the fuel filter and the car should run a low 15 high 14 on that. but for that mustang i can change gears from stock 3.27 to 4.1 for 200 in parts order a shift kit or short throw shifter for either an automatic or manual tranny doesnt matter for 200 in parts put that same vex kit in it with a 125 shot tune the motor fuel filter spark plugs wires and order a timing adjuster to compensate the nitrous and the car will run on nitto 555r drag radials in the quater 12.8 et's all day long and ull never get near it. OH i know this because i have built the mustang never did touch the exhaust system prolly could have got the car into 12.50 with exhaust maybe.

2528767_0	charge of Fe in Fecl3 is 3. . iron has either 2 as valancy or 3. in this case it bonds with three chlorine molecules. therefore its valency and charge is three.
2528767_1	For any ionic compound, you need to know the charges that certain atoms possess.  For chlorine and all other halogens, the charge is always -1.  . . So, we have two things that we definitely know:. . 1) EACH Cl has a charge of -1.. 2) The net charge of FeCl3 is 0 (since it has no superscript).. . So.... . NET CHARGE = (charge of atom #1)(number of that atom) + (charge of atom #2)(number of atom #2) + .... . And for FeCl3.... . 0 = (charge of Fe)(1 atom) + (-1)(3). . ** charge of Fe = +3.  **. . . . You can see that the net charge of all three chlorines alone give -3.  These chlorines and the Fe3+ give a net charge of 0 for the entire molecule.  . . You can check your work by realizing that Fe3+ only has two charge forms: Fe3+, and Fe2+.
2528767_2	Since chloride is an halogen, it has a charge of -1.. Because a molecule always have a charge of zero, the iron must be a positive charge.. There are three Cl, for a total of -3, and only one Fe, that has to have the whole +3 all to itself to balance out the -3 of the 3 Cl.
2528767_3	If you imagine a small 1 as the subscript for Fe then you can criss-cross the subscripts and make them superscripts and those will be the charges. So you have Fe1Cl3. and you criss-cross the charges to get Fe3+ and Cl-1. so the charge on the iron ion is +3
2528767_4	Use the "kriss-cross method".  Just kris-cross the subscripts of each element, and add the proper charge in front of the numbers.  Remember, FeCl3 is saying:  Fe1Cl3, so just switch and put on the top the 1 and the 3.  And then add the + or - charge sign.  Iron is always positive, as are all metals (except perhaps hydrides), and chlorine is always -1, as are all of the Group 7  (halogens) elements.
2528767_5	+3. Since each Cl is -1 and there are 3 Cl needed to make the whole molecule neutral then the Fe must have a charge of +3 because:. -1(3) + 3 = 0

590494_3	The yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to "sympathetically" yawn.[3] The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons, i.e. neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain[4]. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for Imitation which lies at the root of much human learning, e.g. language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse. At a distal level (in terms of evolutionary advantage), yawning might be a herd instinct.[5] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth. This phenomenon has been observed among various primates. The threat gesture is a way of maintaining order in the primates' social structure. The contagion of yawning is interspecific, for example a human yawning in front of a pet dog can incite the dog to yawn as well. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word yawn.. . You could get more information from the link below...

1860702_0	A Hypotonic solution is one in which the concentration of electrolyte is below that in cells. In this situation osmotic pressure leads to the migration of water into the cells, in an attempt to equalize the electrolyte concentration inside and outside the cell walls. If the difference in concentration is significant, the cell walls may rupture, leading to the death of the cell. Consequently, it is vital that the electrolyte concentration of liquids used during blood transfusions be matched to that in cells.
1860702_1	In biology, a hypotonic cell environment is an environment with a lower concentration of solutes than the cytoplasm of the cell. In a hypotonic environment, osmosis causes a net flow of water into the cell, causing the swelling and expansion of the cell. This swelling may lead to the bursting of the cell.. . In summary, a hypertonic solution contains a higher concentration compared to the cell. Hypotonic means it has a lower concentration compared to the cell. Isotonic is a situation in which the concentrations of the cell and of the solution are in an equal ratio.

The way a submarine dives is completely different then denser/less dense ....it's that they are mostly filled with air...so they should float...but they have enough weight that they sink too,  it's almost a balance, but they have tanks that they let fill with water to sink, or push air in (and water out) to get lighter and float.

2155384_11	Anxiety. . Most people experience some level of anxiety as part of everyday living. When anxiety seems persistent and overwhelming, it can interfere with daily functioning.. . Anxiety Disorders are serious medical illnesses that affect approximately 19 million American adults.

2553965_3	Bloody Mary: The Unauthorized Biography. Controversy and intrigue are just two of the ingredients that go into this classic cocktail. Al Martinez spills the story..  .  . RELATED LINK:A Better Bloody.  To sip a Bloody Mary in New York's St. Regis Hotel is to be in the presence of a greater power. Not God, but Fernand "Pete" Petiot, who, it is said, invented what was to become America's favorite morning-after drink, the hangover remedy, the compelling and infamous hair of the dog. . . I sat in the very room, the King Cole Bar, where Pete and the Bloody were introduced to America in the 1930s. While not quite a cathedral, it is nonetheless a lounge of exquisite secular taste, enclosed in the comfort of dark wood and dominated by a large mural of the merry old soul himself, surrounded by an entourage from the lyrical world of the nursery rhyme.. . According to drinking lore, encapsulated in Christopher O'Hara's book The Bloody Mary (with William Nash photographs of such glory that you want to drink the pages), the Bloody was invented by bartender Petiot at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. The basic recipe consisted of vodka, tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne pepper.. . Legend has it that he named it after Queen Mary Tudor, or Bloody Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry VIII, who, during her five-year reign, managed to kill off an impressive number of Protestants. Even by the standards of 16th-century England, the slaughter of some 300 "heretics" seemed excessive.. . Others ascribe the name to a bar in Chicago called "Bucket of Blood," and still others believe it was based on the complaints of a London visitor to Harry's Bar who kept drinking Petiot's tomato juice libation while going on about his wife, Mary. Using one of England's most popular adjectives, the man declared his wife was a bloody nag and bloody impossible, among other bloody evils. So Petiot, in a fit of whimsy, named his drink the Bloody Mary. You can believe any bloody story you like, but most seem to prefer the influence of the bloody Queen.. . However, for those who cant toward a good scare, there is the urban legend of a woman named Mary who was injured in an accident that tore her face so badly she bled to death. Her spirit is said to roam about, and if you stand before a mirror and say Bloody Mary three times, her mangled visage will appear. If so, dash for the door or she'll rip you up, too. You'll surely need a drink after that.. . To continue the more likely tale, John Jacob Astor fell in love with the Bloody at Harry's, and brought Petiot and his drink to The St. Regis, which the Astors owned. Word of its existence spread like a dirty joke, and in no time at all, the Bloody became a standard morning-after libation and, later, one of the drinks favored at a modern invention called brunch, leading it to become at one time the third most popular cocktail in the country. Fearful that the name might offend, however, the Astors renamed it the Red Snapper. But that, forgive me, lacked the snap of the original and ended up in the barrel of bad ideas, where the mango Martini and the Pet Rock reside.. . There are as many ways to prepare a Bloody Mary as there are to cook potatoes. King Cole bartender Gavin Fitzgibbon, himself somewhat of a cocktail historian, assured me that his Bloody was concocted with the same recipe created by Petiot. "We do not," he proclaimed in the grand style of a purist, "attempt to popularize it." Unlike those days in Paris, however, the drink at The St. Regis sells for $17, and while it is a very nice drink, it is not worth three times the price of the taxi that took me to the hotel in the first place.. . In quest of the elusive queen of Bloodies, I tasted samples in such diverse venues as a noisy singles joint called Gladstone's on an L.A. beach, Melrose Place's four-star Bastide, and the elegant Bull and

2173791_6	If you collected data about the heights of adults in your town, there would be a whole range of heights from less than 5 feet to over 6 feet. You could find the arithmetic mean (average) by adding up all the heights and dividing by the number of people. The standard deviation is a fancy way of working out what the average deviation from that mean is. It tells you a little bit more about a population that a simple mean does. For example, two towns might have the same mean height, but one town might be very multicultural and would have a large range of heights (large SD), whereas a very mono-cultural population would mostly fall within a small range (small SD).. . Here are two samples both with the same mean, but very different standard deviations:. . Sample A:  5, 8, 5, 3, 1, 4, 5, 5, 2, 3, 8, 5, 4, 6  (Mean = 4.57; SD = 1.98). Sample B: 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 4  (Mean = 4.57; SD =  0.75)

Then ask who the local agent is, and see if that person will process a claim should you have an accident.  If you don't like the answer to either question, get new insurance first, then cancel the old policy and ask for a refund.
1399727_3	You need to contact the insurance company, to see if the policy is any good.  You ALSO might want to check up on www.ambest.com, to see the rating of that company.  . . Then you need to contact your state insurance department, and report that - it IS insurance fraud to sell insurance if you're not licensed.  Unfortunately, many of the policies are counterfeit, so that's why you need to contact the company, also.  . . I'd report it to the company as well, btw.

3921805_8	I suppose it was a swear word in the context of polite society of the time.  I guess it gives a colourful expression too, of "blood" - red/anger/danger/pain.. . Plus we've all been increasingly exposed to much worse swearing as expressions of coolness/displaying aggression/annoyance, on a daily basis, in all forms of media ; tv, movies, print - so swear words like "bloody" seem quite quaint.. . In the 1939 GWTW movie, when Rhett Butler said "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn".  I think the word "damn" cause a stir at the time as being highly risque language.

201033_5	This has to do with air densities and at different temperatures you have different densities. Just so happens that for every form of matter, colder means heavier which means more density. . . If cold air is denser then it weighs more given the same volume of hot air. So in weighing more, the cold air will fall rather than rise. . . So in making a freezer with the freezing compartment at the top is just a form of efficiency. The motor has to do less work in disposing of the cold air. When it is released gravity does the rest of the job and pulls it downwards while the warmer air rises.. . That's why at super markets freezers look like pools because they keep cold air in which does not rise but keeps hot air out which would not settle down low.

3509991_1	LaL is correct. when dealing with freezing points that approach absolute zero (-273) you must use the kelvin scale for recording temp. The Kelvin scale is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale where absolute zero—the lowest possible temperature where nothing could be colder and no heat energy remains in a substance—is defined as zero kelvin (0 K). The unit increment of the Kelvin scale is the kelvin (symbol: K), which is the SI unit of temperature and is one of the seven SI base units. The unit “kelvin” and its scale by international agreement, defined by two points: absolute zero, and the triple point of specially prepared (VSMOW) water. This definition also precisely relates the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale. Absolute zero—the temperature at which nothing could be colder and no heat energy remains in a substance—is defined as being precisely 0 K and −273.15 °C. The triple point of water is defined as being precisely 273.16 K and 0.01 °C

It is not the fault of Religion, but the fault of the evil people using it for their own purposes.. . We are getting closer to a time when people will start to realize that and come back to God.. .

4353714_7	Republicans are concidered racists because they're not afraid to say that they are proud to be white or in my case german/pennsylvania dutchy. But apparently say ur proud to be a powerful race says that you hate all minorities which is bull. . . But how can you blame a racist for being that way. My mother works in a prison where theres thousands of prisoners, she estimates less then 100 are white, the rest are hispanic and black.

4337286_0	Lose 10 pounds in 2 weeks??. . There are some websites on the Internet, which promise you that you are going to lose 10 pounds in every 2 weeks. If you are good in math you will find that keeping these stats in mind, 260 pounds in a year. Losing 260 pounds is the figure, which is unbelievable and unexpected.. . This kind of claims are planned just to cause clients to make impulsive decisions. When you gain weight, did you gained around 50 minds in two months? Certainly not. We gain weight in weight in small parts, which add up to our weight. This keeps on increasing with time.. . I think you get what I mean to say. We normally gain weight in grams like 65 gram per week. With this stat you are going to gain around 7 pounds at the end of year.. . This weight is so slow that you cannot measure it weekly. But in fur years you are going to gain around 28 pounds.. . So how can you expect this weight to go in few days? You are going to lose the way you have gained it. So it will take time to lose weight. So you have to start losing weight systematically. You can lose weight by developing the good eating habits in you and nutritious foods.

This is straight forward for DC; with AC things become a little more difficult, as because of the fluctuation of the voltage, the average is only .707 of the nominal voltage.

2539741_1	cracked block or cracked head or blown head gasket. Sounds like you have a rod knocking you need to replace motor or just get a new car dont sound like it would be worth rebuilding the engine
2539741_2	blown head gasket or block i would quit driving it til you get it fixed or you may have to replace the whole motor
2539741_3	You have a blown head gasket and possibly a cracked head.  Since it is a 93, I would suggest replacing the car.  You can get a different car for what it will cost to fix this old beast.
2539741_4	your motor is knocking, gasket could be blown
2539741_5	Head gasket!!!. . In other words your motor is GONE!!!
2539741_6	Its got to be a blown head gasket, My friend had the same knocking problem, changed the head gasket and the knocking went away. But, you should know, changing the head gasket will take the problem away for a while but you have to fix what caused the head gasket to blow too, make sure you talk to your mechanic about that or he'll end up ripping you off cuz you'll have to fix it again.

3222773_1	A monk is someone who lives an ascetic lifestyle. That means "a rigorous denial of the body for the purpose of spiritual growth." Monks usually live alone and spend their time praying, fasting and stuff.  Sometimes they live in monastaries, but they still spend time alone.
1186189_13	I took a course on ridding oneself of anxiety and depression last year.  One of the techniques described and taught was self-talk - what we tell ourselves.. . What you do is talk to yourself as you would talk to a friend.  Make yourself "scripts" to reverse the negative things that you tell yourself.  After you do this for a few weeks, you start to believe it - really.. . Try the books by Lucinda Bassett on anxiety and depression.  They go into more detail and explain how self-talk can increase your self-esteem and confidence.. . Good luck and God bless!

1207074_4	Nice question. I think that wisdom is a specific type of knowlege that is highly applicable and helpful in practical situations. Knowledge is a broad category of all of the truths that a person can intellectually understand. I see wisdom as the smaller set of psychological or philosophical truths that one has gained, usually through experience. Wisdom is the knowledge of uncommon truth(s) that directly influences one's thoughts, feelings, and actions.. . I guess I believe this because of how frequently the word "wise" is associated with an old person who acts and thinks differently than other people because he has a greater understanding of the nature of things around him. The stereotypical example would be someone like Gandalf or Dumbledore.
1207074_10	Knowledge is what you are able to take in and use. Wisdom, however, only comes with time. You can be the smartest person in the world and have absolutely no wisdom whatsoever at the same time.
1207074_25	Wisdom is knowing how to use knowledge correctly.  Anyone can have knowledge but a wise person will make the better choices.

788976_0	I've not heard that there was a cover up.  But I'm sure Bush haters came up with that one.  Let's face it, Clinton is to blame for 911m after all he had 8 years to take out OBL which is when the 911 planning was being done.  Bush inherited a mess from ole Bill, slow economy, a military in ruin, and lost respect for the oval office.. Bush has made his mistakes also, but we have record low unemployment, more new home owners, and a military that loves their commander in chief. (I live in a military town)
788976_1	It is amazing how many loons come out when this subject is brought up.
788976_2	Oh, come on! Don't you know it has been debunked over and over again. There is also a million dollar reward for any body who can prove it. Once more ppl are swayed by Media (Internet) with no proof. You ppl watch TV too much.
788976_3	what part was covered up. we have seen thousands of videos, there are countless websites, and more conspiracy theories than if Elvis killed JFK. what about the even was covered up? remember, thousands of people died that day, and there are thousands of families with out a parent/child. you are disrespecting the memories of the victims, you are disrespecting the families of the victims. you need to let this go. there was a conspiracy on 9/11. it was between the 20 or so hijackers and bin laden.
788976_4	and yet another conspiracy theory nutjob?????sheeeesh!
788976_5	That governments have permitted terrorist acts against their own people, and have even themselves been perpetrators in order to find strategic advantage is quite likely true, but this is the United States we're talking about.. . That intelligence agencies, financiers, terrorists and narco-criminals have a long history together is well established, but the Nugan Hand Bank, BCCI, Banco Ambrosiano, the P2 Lodge, the CIA/Mafia anti-Castro/Kennedy alliance, Iran/Contra and the rest were a long time ago, so there’s no need to rehash all that. That was then, this is now!. . That Jonathan Bush’s Riggs Bank has been found guilty of laundering terrorist funds and fined a US-record $25 million must embarrass his nephew George, but it's still no justification for leaping to paranoid conclusions.. . That George Bush's brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Centre, Dulles Airport and United Airlines means nothing more than you must admit those Bush boys have done alright for themselves.. . That George Bush found success as a businessman only after the investment of Osama’s brother Salem and reputed al Qaeda financier Khalid bin Mahfouz is just one of those things - one of those crazy things.. . That Osama bin Laden is known to have been an asset of US foreign policy in no way implies he still is.. . That al Qaeda was active in the Balkan conflict, fighting on the same side as the US as recently as 1999, while the US protected its cells, is merely one of history's little aberrations.. . The claims of Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the Jeddah visa bureau, that the CIA ran the office and issued visas to al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States, sound like the sour grapes of someone who was fired for making such wild accusations.. . That one of George Bush's first acts as President, in January 2001, was to end the two-year deployment of attack submarines which were positioned within striking distance of al Qaeda's Afghanistan camps, even as the group's guilt for the Cole bombing was established, proves that a transition from one administration to the next is never an easy task.. . That so many influential figures in and close to the Bush White House had expressed, just a year before the attacks, the need for a "new Pearl Harbor" before their militarist ambitions could be fulfilled, demonstrates nothing more than the accidental virtue of being in the right place at the right time.. . That the company PTECH, founded by a Saudi financier placed on America’s Terrorist Watch List in October 2001, had access to the FAA’s entire computer system for two years before the 9/11 attack, means he must not have been such a threat after all.. . That whistleblower Indira Singh was told to keep her mouth shut and forget what she learned when she took her concerns about PTECH to her employers and federal authorities, suggests she lacked the big picture. And that the Chief Auditor for JP Morgan Chase told Singh repeatedly, as she answered questions about who supplied her with what information, that "that person should be killed," suggests he should take an anger management seminar.. . That on May 8, 2001, Dick Cheney took upon himself the job of co-ordinating a response to domestic terror attacks even as he was crafting the administration’s energy policy which bore implications for America's military, circumventing the established infrastructure and ignoring the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman report, merely shows the VP to be someone who finds it hard to delegate.. . That the standing order which covered the shooting down of hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, is simply poor planning and unfortunate timing. Fortunately the error has been corrected, as the order
788976_6	What proof do you have other than reading the 9/11 conspiracy theory's..which cannot prove any thing...
788976_7	because when 9/11 occured, Bush and his entourage were sitting in an elementary school reading a picture book to little children. once he found out, he still sat there for another 20 minutes, continued reading, ignoring the urgent call of the united states emergency. if you would like to here more about it, rent the excellently acclaimed Farenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore. . . Yes, I am a democrat against Bush, but that does not really sway my vote. What bush did on 9/11 was against morals and ethics, ignorning the cries for help.
788976_8	What happened on 9/11?   Why am I always the last to hear about these things!!!!
788976_9	OK, I am not a Bush fan. But regarding this conspiracy theory...Its bogus. Just stop and think. has Bush been able to successfully cover up anything since he got into office? Come on, now, be honest. Every time Bush has tried to lie to the American people he got caught early on. Every time. He is as adept as a drunken man stumbling across an icy street. For Bush to undertake a cover up of the magnitude you suggest and not get caught right away...impossible my friend. his dirty fingerprints would be all over it like the doorknob of a bus station restroom.
788976_10	Cover up? Something happened on 9/11?  Gee, I wish someone somewhere reported it!!! Thank goodness for whistleblowers like you! You should run for office, ye hero!

788976_15	I do not think they think they did anything wrong.  They are in a position of such power that they think they are infallible and to this day they relish that power. Bush just put in his Administratiom a bunch of egotistic wealthy people who do not care for the common man or woman.
788976_16	Duh... Cause man,  No-one could see that the planes were flying into the buildings, so no-one would blame the Taliban for it.  They knew that stupid people who hate our country would come up with a ridiculous theory like the one you are suggesting....duh
788976_17	They did not want to admit that George was asleep at the wheel for most of his presidency and his lack of vigillance made this adminsitration look bad.  God knows they had enough warnings.

If you increase the concentration of hydrogen by adding more acid, like making the solution contain 1x10-3 M, the pH would be 3. It continues to follow this pattern and even can go negative.

2309774_9	Don't try to make this an issue about the soldiers. Everyone wants the soldiers to be safe at home. You know all along that everyone is dissing Bush, not the troops.
2309774_10	I haven't seen anyone talking badly about the soldiers in Iraq.  I think most people have sympathy for the soldiers.  It's the policies that have all of you in the Middle East that are upsetting.. . I think the problem arises because supporters of the War think people who are against the war shouldn't speak out against it.  . . If I don't believe in the War I am not going to feel guilty about supporting a war nor will I go out of my way to coddle the service people.
2309774_11	don't read the postings. they are "dissing" on the soldiers on television also. FYI- they will give him leave .....my friends husband had leave after 6 months. we are not in the Vietnam war where the max time away from family was a year.
2309774_12	being a vet.of two wars i could go into long stories and shed a little light on your so-called "hero's"but,i'd just be wasting my breath.no matter how well you know the people who go to war,they are not the people you know when they are there and you are here.. the truth of the story is we fired blindly and never knew the exact direction of our firing,we never knew how many innocent women and children were killed by our fire.we were told not to let it bother us,we were told all of them were the enemy and we were just killing trash.. does your husband or your brother have trouble sleeping?if they don't,,thats why they deserve to be "dissed".anyone proud of taking another human life reguardless of reason,doesn't deserve to called a human being.human being do not kill.animals kill.but at least animals kill for survival,not for fun or a paycheck.we had no business in iraq.is that your husbands or your brothers fault?no!i am calling them less than human?maybe.am i less than human?yes.am i proud?no!do i still have nightmares?yes.. your husband and brother did what they had to do,i doubt if they are proud of it,if they were forced to kill.but,i imagine they are proud of their country.. you'll have to forgive,i have problems talking about this.i may seem harsh but the wars i fought in were nam/korea.when i go back,my mind clouds.i hope your hus/bro,do not suffer as i have .at least they didn't come to protestors who spit in their faces while carrying signs calling them baby killers.
2309774_13	Because they're selfish, narrow minded, and bigoted.  Your men are on the front line doing the right thing- that is, they signed on, and they're being professional about it.. . Keep the faith, and keep them in your prayers, and screw the naysayers.. . If they refuse to support our soldiers while in the rear they are MORE than welcome to lead from the front
2309774_14	The current US military needs to start showing a little appreciation for the unprecedented amount of public support they get from American citizens.
2309774_15	i have heard that people who don't have capabilities in norm life they do join forces....if we are not their  it also means something else to us....cleared....second, if u r joining USA army, it means u would have to fight also, since USA is well known now for invading other countries...... and if u let them join the army, you shouldn't be asking this question...it is their choice and will..........o.kay..... I don;t know what oath they took for USA army, but usually it is like " u'll defend your country in any case". if they r fight in Iraq, they r not fighting for USA to defend O.KAY...... they r just their to kill some one innocent....who is very furious revenging and fed up of USA troops killing civilian...and in that fight ur relative could also be killed.....and its true...and that is y when they came back from this war they got caught over with guilt and become physique case.....isn't?. this could be harsh but fact......so thank God we are not in their place..bcoz we cannot kill any innocent people...
2309774_16	Name a single person who has said anything bad about the troops. And, Kerry is not one. He was clearly talking about Bush and anyone who would bother to just look at the sentence immediately before the clip the Republican lie is based on would no that. . . Within a few months following Tuesday’s election, Bush will begin redeploying the troops in Iraq. He is leaving them there for now because he knows it would hurt Republicans at the polls if he did it before then. But the bottom line is that he is leaving them there to be injured and die for his own personal political reasons, and not for any military strategic purpose.. . Iraq is lost – just like Colin Powell and Bush’s father predicted would happen. If anyone disrespects the troops it is the Bush administration who sacrifices their blood on the altar of Osama Bin-Laden for immoral reasons. You may not like it, but that is the truth. Every death in Iraq is purposeless (except to benefit Bush and his gang of US Constitution destroying fascists).
2309774_17	i give mad props to our soldiers. i know i don't have the BALLS to do what they do. granted it is a bullshit reason we are over there (Iraq, Afghanistan) but i would rather have the fighting over there than here in the united states. if anyone has a problem wit our men and women at war than take it up with your congress people not our troops, they are just doing what their "boss" (Bush) told them to do.
2309774_18	because they shouldn't go over there to fight in a war for our "C" average president, i know in ways they are fighting for their country and for our protection, its just that people that have had a loss of a solider or a close friend that is how they just express their anger.  I'm not saying I'm against  the war because I'm not (hello its for my protection) but this war is already settled and its time for our troops to come back....they are trying to handle another countries problems....who cares let that other country solve their own problems...anyway i agree with you and i also think that its time this war is over.
2309774_19	I am a gulf war vet (E-5, 91A, 93rd Evac Hospital) My nephew is in Iraq now. We disagree 100% with the lying thief in command Bush. But we would never disrespect our fellow soldiers or country. These right-wing fascists that say Democrats disrespect the soldiers are full of sshhit. This war is based on greed and lies, that is fact. It is an UNJUST war. That doesn't mean we disrespect any soldiers, we ARE soldiers. Democrats are mad because the war is a lie and it is costing BILLIONS of dollars and thousands of US soldiers lies. Of course Haliburton is making millions on it too. If right-wing nerds love the war so much, THEY should go volunteer. AND shut up. They're too busy golfing though. And who is "dissing" soldiers anyway?. Also, no one has used the term "diss" in years, especially if your white.
2309774_20	Dissing... how ignorant. Many "diss" the soldiers due to idiotic reasons, for those who do not know what idiot means, it means unacknowledged. People criticize the soldiers, when infact they truly mean to do so towards the government or the Bush administration and their retarded standards.
2309774_21	I have not seen anyone dissing our troups. I have seen comments against our involvement in Iraq, but that is far from the same thing.
2309774_22	The reason there is disdain for soldiers is possibly because they volunteer to go kill people who just want to be left alone completely.    Our soldiers don't have any business there, and if there was a draft, our eager government would see how many people will dodge it and it might open their eyes to the travesty this all is.  All soldiers are only machines that the government has control of; they follow commands and are "fixed" if they don't.

1391529_1	All some scumbags care about is making money. Not just pitbull backyard breeders but ALL backyard breeders. They don't care about their dogs they just want to make money and right now the hoodlums think pitbulls make them look tough and then there are the Paris Hilton wannabees who have to have a small dog. Whatever is popular those scumbags will breed just to make money.THEY should be nuetered to end their idiot genes from being bred.
1391529_9	Well, it is already illegal in some states just to have a "pit bull"  Unfortunately that doesn't stop everyone. I think your ideas have a lot of merit. CE
1391529_10	Pitbulls scar me.  I don't go near them and I don't want them near me.  I think something should be done with the people who use them for the sport of dog fighting.  That is very cruel thing to do to a Pitbull, in fact any dog for that matter.  I think it's because of this that the dogs have a bad reputation.  Concerning Pitbulls, and for the people who love them, they will tell you that it depends how the dogs are raised.  But still, they were bred to be aggressive.
1391529_13	People won't stop doing it because there's a large market for them. So long as there are emotionally insecure people who need monster dogs as a surrogate penis there will always be a market for pit bulls.

As it was, though, we gave Saddam a year to pack up his weapons and move them/hide them, plus prepare all his evil terrorists for when the Americans arrived!  It wasn't a good start, then to have so many unfaithful American's announcing they won't and don't support our military in Iraq, (poor men and women soldiers to feel that their country turned against them.) Then for the soldiers to hear from loved ones about the negatism on the evening news, rather than about all of the Iraqi people who LOVED the Americans and THANKED them so much for being there to HELP them!   Now, with a civil war, even I'm ready to bring our Americans home!  What gets me is WHY the evil segment of Iraq's people don't want peace!  I guess the bottom line is that when you begin teaching a kid at only 2 years old to "HATE", it justs becomes who they are!

2831596_5	For other uses, see Yawn (disambiguation).. . . A dog yawning. A yawn (synonyms chasma, oscitation from the Latin verb oscitare, to open the mouth wide[1]) is a reflex of deep inhalation and exhalation associated with being tired, with a need to sleep, or from lack of stimulation. Pandiculation is the term for the act of stretching and yawning. Yawning is a powerful non-verbal message with several possible meanings, depending on the circumstances. It is also claimed to help increase the state of alertness of a person. The exact causes of yawning are still unknown.. . Contents.  [hide]. 1 Origin of the word. 2 Causes of yawning. 3 Contagiousness. 4 Trivia. 5 Superstitions. 6 Notes. 7 External links. [edit]Origin of the word. . The word "yawn" has evolved from the Middle English word yanen, an alteration of yonen, or yenen, which in turn comes from the Old English geonian.. [edit]Causes of yawning. . An indication of tiredness, stress, over-work, or boredom.. An action indicating psychological decompression after a state of high alert.. A means of expressing powerful emotions like anger, rejection, apathy or tedium.. Caused by low oxygen in the brain. A yawn can express strong anti-social messages, and so in some cultures people try to mute or mask them by placing a concealing hand over the yawning mouth.. . . A cat yawning. A previous long-standing hypothesis is that yawning is caused by an excess of carbon dioxide and lack of oxygen in the blood. The brain stem detects this and triggers the yawn reflex. The mouth stretches wide and the lungs inhale deeply, bringing oxygen into the lungs and hence to the bloodstream. It is almost certain, however, that this hypothesis is not correct. One study has documented that this effect does not exist.[2]. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions, mood, appetite and other phenomena. These chemicals include serotonin, dopamine, glutamic acid and nitric oxide. As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opiate neurotransmitters such as endorphins, reduces the frequency of yawning. Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often. Another theory is that yawning is similar to stretching. Yawning, like stretching, increases blood pressure and heart rate while also flexing many muscles and joints. It is also theorized that yawning helps redistribute an oil-like substance which coats the lungs and aids breathing. Some have observed that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is unsatisfying. As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.. Some movements in psychotherapy such as Re-evaluation Counseling or co-counselling believe that yawning, along with laughter and crying are means of "discharging" painful emotion, and therefore can be encouraged in order to promote physical and emotional healing.. [edit]Contagiousness. . The yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to "sympathetically" yawn.[3] The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons, i.e. neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain[4]. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for Imitation which lies at the root of much human learning, e.g. language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse. At a distal level (in terms of evolutionary advantage), yawning might be a herd instinct.[5] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synch

3369088_2	Why would you want to stop the spread of Islam?. . This is a free country, Muslims have the right to spread their religion as much as they want. It's a safe and peaceful religion, and they have the right to preach their beliefs as much as any other religion does.. . It's really those extremist Muslims that corrupt the minds of many Americans, like you, who make the American public believe that Islam is a violent religion of suicide bombers and terrorists. Islam is NOT such a religion. Islam strictly condones any violence and acts of terrorism and Hell is the punishment for those people. Islam promotes peace, unity, and respect to everyone, even those who are not Muslims.. . Your question should read, "How can we stop the spread of EXTREMIST Islam?". . That's something that I would want to put an end to.

1005351_4	Probably because ADHD has more vocal lobby groups, and it seems to be a catch-all for misbehaving kids. If parents can find a 'cause' for their noisy and disobedient kids, wouldn't that be more desirable than having people simply say their kids are badly brought up? Not saying that ADHD isn't a real problem - some kids really do need help for it - but that ADHD's draw factors are more compelling than those of depression and anxiety.. . Also, the fact that kids are sometimes prescribed drugs for ADHD instantly gives it controversy. Most kids who suffer from depression and anxiety are given counselling over drugs, so less controversy there.. . Plus, having it on Desperate Housewives definitely gave it even more attention!

443848_0	You did not say what kind of training you are looking for.. . Basic obedience?  There is a lot of information out there and it just depends on the method or modification you want to work with.  It is best that you do the training yourself.  There are training classes everywhere you look if you want to do in that kind of setting to were there are a lot of distractions of other dogs and other people around.  I like to get the basic training done without all the extra distractions.  Once the basics are installed it is wise to go to different places so that the footing is different.  Like a walk down a side walk, walk them through a carpeted area, bare ground, think forest etc.  Also where people and other animals are so that he/she learns to be observant but will not break her training.. . If you want instructions on how to teach him/her to pull a sled start out with, say a wagon pulling a couple of kids or rocks.  I don't think this is what you were looking for cause you didn't say if you had several or just one.. . I myself like the behavior modification rather than the method training.  I feel that it is more reliable.  I have used this to train police dogs and personal protection dogs, search and rescue, personal pets and it works for all types of training.. . Good luck
443848_1	Siberian huskies are tough dogs but they are very smart and can learn quickly.  . . For basic obedience, I recommend you look at your local library for "Siberian Huskies for Dummies" or "the Dog Whisperer", both are very helpful books.  If your local library does not have them, you can ask them (usually available on their website) for an interlibrary loan.  . . A good website for husky-specific training tips was mentioned above: http://www.husky-petlove.com/husky_alpha_training.html.  I tried these ideas with my dog and had great results.  . . Some tips:. Huskies cannot be trained to be off a leash.  Period.  . . If you NEVER feed your dog from the table, (s)he will NEVER beg.  . . If you limit food (most Huskies only need 1 cup of dry food twice per day, according to our vet), then you can use food as a great motivator, even if it is just a small morsel of bread or a kibble.  To train your dog to kiss with his nose, you can say "kiss" then physically move his nose to contact your cheek, then say "good boy" and give a food reward.  After about 5 of these (s)he will be trained.  . . If basic obedience is a problem, make sure you are giving your husky enough exercise.  It makes a huge difference.  . . Good luck.

Firstly accept every failure as a challenge.Have faith on God.Before starting anything pray Him to do that work for you.Remember that you can win,never let yourself think that you  are a poor fellow.Decide your goal and just think you can win.Go head doing hardwork and with a desire to win.Make your yourself hard to face failures.Work hard that you will not have to run behind succes but success will have to run towards you.                    .                                  Remember:. Winners don't do Different things they do things Differently.. Good luck.
2446614_8	Dear Saurabh. Why are we so obsessed with 'getting' success? . Let us for some time forget about these terms 'Success' and 'Failure'. Just do what you want and like to do and do it really well. Believe me, success will be a byproduct of such a process.
2446614_9	Try , try, try ..till you succeed.. . Have to work very,very,very,..... hard.. . Little bit of luck may not hurt.
2446614_10	first step for success : allow ur self with failures... once u start accepting failures...  u won't be low with failures and keep on trying... and one fine day success knock ur door.......
1456895_1	The reason why our world is watching this is because our soldiers are out there fighting for our lives and protecting AMERICA, They  ( The Iraq's)kill their own people especially children because the think they are doing right by GOD.

2663365_3	Yea you can & you should especially if it is directly associated with your employment. EXAMPLE: TRUCK DRIVERS, BUS DRIVERS, EMTS, ETC, etc... When you dont fight the ticket its like admitting to the crime.  Unfortunately, your guilty until proven innocent.
3024070_2	You pose a good question.  Bush has said that he supports Adult Stem Cells but he just does not want to pay for it.  Stemcells, Inc. just last week launched the first patient trial with Adult cells placed in the brain of a patient.  Funding is there but mostly from sharedholders and Universities.  So why does the public not demand it?  It is like anything else, a good idea that has to be proven in order to believe in it.

3385998_11	The term High Church is used to differentiate the various factions of the Church of England (nothing to do with the americans at all ). The High Wing is that section that relates to Roman Catholic thinking and practise whereas the low wing is evangelical and does not regard the role of priesthood and ritual with great fondness. . The High Church or Anglo-Catholic faction is almost identical in dogma and worship as their Roman Catholic cousins and though many regard the Pontiff with affection, do not regard Him as having any authority over them (though it doesn't stop them copying and adopting every known Roman Catholic practise!)Contrary to the questioner, most High Church membership is concentrated in the South and West of England.. Just read the answer before mine, the High Church most definately believes in the Presence of Christ in the Eucharist!

1831737_1	Two reasons:  (1) When you do any type of workout, your muscles produce lactic acid.  Your muscles get irritated by it and it takes a while for your body to get rid of it.  To help get rid of it faster, stretch post-workout and drink more water.  (2) When too much stress is applied to muscles -- particularly when doing weight/strength training -- the muscles develop microscopic tears in the fibers.  When the fibers get torn it irritates the nerve endings in the tissue until your body repairs the tears, which can take one or two days.

1977054_4	It is of Berber origin. It consists of grains made from semolina that are about 1 mm or 1/16th inch in diameter (after cooking).It is the y staple food throughout the Maghreb; in much of Algeria, eastern Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya .
1977054_5	Couscous is NOT 'a' wheat - it's made FROM wheat! Like pasta.. . If you mean what part of the world does it originate from, it's from a vague area including North Africa and Morocco - some or all of which were 'ruled' for some time by the French, explaining the spelling and pronunciation of 'harissa'!
1977054_6	Couscous, the most popular dish from Morocco and North Africa, is now appreciated worldwide. . .  Historians have different opinions as to the origin of couscous. Some claim that couscous, like pasta, originated from China; while others trace its origin to East Africa. However the most plausible evidence points to a North African origin. Indeed, archaeological evidence dating back to the 9th Century and consisting of kitchen utensil needed to prepare this dish was found in this part of the world.
1977054_7	Couscous (IPA /kʊskʊs/ - Berber Seksu - Arabic: كسكس‎ [1]) is a food of the Maghreb of Berber origin. It consists of grains made from semolina that are about 1 mm or 1/16th inch in diameter (after cooking).. . The dish is the primary staple food throughout the Maghreb; in much of Algeria, eastern Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya it is simply known as ta`aam طعام, "food". It is popular in the Maghreb, the West African Sahel, in France, in western Sicily's Trapani province, and parts of the Middle East. It is also very popular among Jews of North African descent.. . Couscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the hard wheat Triticum durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the relatively primitive millstone. The name is also used for prepared dishes made from other grains, such as barley, millet, sorghum, rice, or maize. Couscous is traditionally served under a meat or vegetable stew.. . In the United States couscous is known as a type of pasta, probably reflecting the influence of Sicilian immigrants. However in most other countries it is treated more like a grain in its own right. It is particularly valued for its rapid preparation time.. . In French-speaking countries in sub-Saharan Africa, fufu is often called cous-cous.

3920126_4	Bandying all teenagers into a group that only buys tat is a bit silly really.. . Yes, a lot of teenagers like what I would consider to be crap music. Good on them. I liked crap music when I was a teenager too. When you're a teenager you don't necessarily want to sit there listening to the deep meaning within music. You want to jump up and down and listen to music that gives you a buzz.. . So let them buy what they like. I pay no attention to the charts anymore anyway and just buy what I like. My daughter listens to crap but I have a louder stereo than her so I can drown it out.. . Crap like Robbie Williams/Westlife is brought by more people over 30 than by teenagers as well... consider that mate....

2796298_0	Sound is changes in air/gas pressure so if you have no air/gas of which to change the pressure you have no sound.  I'm thinking the energy would be converted to heat and motion of the particles colliding rather than generating changes in air pressure or sound.  A perfect vaccum is an absense of of all matter.  This is an unacheivable state so there will still be gas in the container it is just at a lower pressure than the atmosphere.

3498093_1	Lose 10 pounds in 2 weeks??. . There are some websites on the Internet, which promise you that you are going to lose 10 pounds in every 2 weeks. If you are good in math you will find that keeping these stats in mind, 260 pounds in a year. Losing 260 pounds is the figure, which is unbelievable and unexpected.. . This kind of claims are planned just to cause clients to make impulsive decisions. When you gain weight, did you gained around 50 minds in two months? Certainly not. We gain weight in weight in small parts, which add up to our weight. This keeps on increasing with time.. . I think you get what I mean to say. We normally gain weight in grams like 65 gram per week. With this stat you are going to gain around 7 pounds at the end of year.. . This weight is so slow that you cannot measure it weekly. But in fur years you are going to gain around 28 pounds.. . So how can you expect this weight to go in few days? You are going to lose the way you have gained it. So it will take time to lose weight. So you have to start losing weight systematically. You can lose weight by developing the good eating habits in you and nutritious foods.

202603_8	Everything will freeze if you turn the temperature down low enough. Amazing as it might sound, Heineken does actually contain alcohol - which has a much lower freezing point than water... so it acts as an anti-freeze.. . [useless fact alert] freezing alcoholic beverages is technically illegal because when they do freeze the "water" part of the drink freezes and the "alcohol" part stays liquid and can then be poured off. This is basically distillation and is particularly used when making illicit "whiskey" by freezing wine (in Ireland they make potato wine and freeze it to make "poteen" - potato whiskey... highly illegal and liable to take the top of your head off!).

The tungsten, halogen, or whatever material the filaments are manufactured with, tend to return to the "wire" form, but they form unevenly, causing weak spots that eventually wear out and break, causing the "burned-out bulb" condition.

2732477_0	The chief pilot who flies  a commercial flight is known as the commander of the flight.  As the names suggests, he is in charge of the plane as long as it is in flight and he is solely responsible for everything that happens during the flight.  All other crew members including the first officer (2nd pilot) report to him. He is also responsbile for the safety of the passengers and the aircraft.  Commander is who commands the aircraft and his word is final.  . Air Force pilots are not authorised to fly commercial flights as longs as they do not hold commercial pilot licence.  They are flying military aircrfts such as fighter planes.  There are many Air Force pilots who fly passenger aircrafts of the military.  . If an Air Force pilots wants to fly a commercial aircraft he has to first join the Commercial Airline and get the necessary endorsement to fly the commercial aircraft which he wants to fly.  This is given after completing the necessary class room training and flying training.  For example, a pilot who is flying an Airbus aircraft can not fly a Boeing aircraft unless he holds licence to fly both these aircrafts as method of flying and cockpit are different for each aircraft.

3040519_1	I live in Ontario, Canada, and there is a pitbull ban here.. . This is what the government said - . . Ban pit bulls . Muzzle existing pit bulls, impose other province-wide restrictions to improve public safety, and allow municipalities to impose appropriate controls . Increase fines up to a maximum of $10,000 and allow for jail sentences of up to six months for owners of any dangerous dog that bites, attacks, or poses a threat to public safety. . . . There were several highly publisized attacks, after that, they put the ban in.
3040519_4	"Pit bulls" are being banned because of this legislation that gets put into place within the community/state/province/country.  This legislation is called BREED SPECIFIC LEGISLATION (or BSL).  It targets all "aggressive" breeds such as rottweilers, "pit bulls", doberman pinchers, German Shepard's, etc.. . Italy has over 90 different breeds banned from their country.  Eventually, the country Will be dog-less.. . The legislation is put in place by people that fear the breed...and has had unfortunate accidents happen to them or friends.  They believe it is sole the dog's responsibility on how it acted.  They believe certain "types" of dog inherently are aggressive, and therefore are menace to society.  They believe that they are qualified in making the decision on what breed is worthy to live or not.  They believe that owners of said dogs have no responsibility towards the dog that cause the accident and should be allowed to carry on with life as it was before.  Meanwhile the dog gets destroyed.  The media then plays into those beliefs to get more support to push the issue.. . To my knowledge there are several Canadian cities that have muzzle laws or ban the breed specifically, as well as many American states, counties, and cities that ban these breeds.  You need to look at the specific community under animal control to find if they have any laws pertaining to BSL.
3040519_5	Generalizing, pitbulls can be VERY violent and they are famous for attacking people...pitbulls are banned in Miami, Florida I think... . more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull
3040519_6	Miami Florida, and they are banned because they're jaws lock I remember I was walking my dog and a pitbull bit my dog on the neck and it's jaw locked on my dogs coller and my dog wheres a spikey coller for protection and the pitbulls mouth was shut so hard not only could the dog not open it but human hands couldn't open it so we sent it to the animal hospital and a few days later a story about a little girl whose leg got ripped off  cuz her pitbull bit her on her leg and his jaw locked on her leg (the dog was killed after and I don't know what happen to the girl)
3040519_7	there's a few dozen communities that have banned pit bulls because there has been a lot of media hype over people getting killed by pit bulls. the only controlled study on the subject found that only german shepherds and chows are more statistically more likely to bite. However, when a pit bull bites, it is more likely to be fatal. . A lot of this legislation has been based on statistical data from the CDC that breaks down dog bite related fatalities according to the breed of dog. Right now rottweilers and pit bulls are at the top of the list. Statisitics that break up dog bite related fatalities are inaccurate in a lot of ways. They do no account for the percentage of the dog population - popular breeds will obviously show up more than rare ones. Also, they do not take into account the role the owner plays. Because of their reputations, pit bulls are often selected by people who want a mean dog. You can make a golden retriever mean if you want to, but you wouldn't get one if you wanted to. So pit bulls end up being more likely to be mean b/c they are more likely to be purchased by idiots. I posted a list of resources over in the page about rottie v. pit bull, if you would like to look at that.
3040519_8	Im not really sure where Pitbull r ban, but I can tell u y dey r ban. Sum reason cuz dey're fightin' and aggresive dog.

2605342_12	Um, yeah, sort of.. See, here's what the deal is:  the federal government has reserved for itself the right to enforce immigration law.  That means that regular police officers, city and county governments, etc. have no jurisdiction when it comes to immigration law enforcement.  . The republicans, in charge of the white house *and* congress for the past 6 years, could have passed a law in congress giving immigration enforcement powers to local law enforcement agencies -- but they didn't.  They let the current laws stand, which means regular cops on the street -- even when they come across someone they know is an illegal immigrant -- can't deport them or arrest them simply for being here illegally.  That power rests solely with the federal government.

If you're dead then you are not alive so you are dead, if you are dead then how can you be alive, so you can not wake up dead since you are not alive but if you are alive then dead then you know you are dead so you have to be dead to wake up dead but you don't know you are dead if you are not alive but if you are alive then sure you know you are dead but after you are alive then dead you do not know you are dead so you have to be alive to know you are dead. If you are not wake when you are dead then you do not know you are dead. So you can not wake up if you are dead only if you are alive you know you are dead then after you do not know you are dead only if you were alive to be dead.. . . Got it. . Hope this helps
3562931_1	Wow.. Spell it with me.... B-r-a-i-l-l-e. Not 'brail'. . It's so blind people who know Braille can operate the machine.. . And for all the people asking about the drive-thru ones.....if they're already making the machines with Braille, why make special machines without just for drive-thru ATM'S?. Think.

716987_1	Maybe because instead of wasting his time writing a book, he was out preaching, curing people and saving lives. . If you don't believe, u can find any little detail to ridiculise our religion. It's not that hard. . I don't understand why some people hate christianism, i mean what is wrong with the original true message to love one another. . If people throughout history used this religion to do bad things ( and continue to) that doesn't make the original message bad , it makes those particular people bad.
2800339_2	ADH does not directly affect potassium concentrations, rather aldosterone does that. ADH could affect potassium concentrations in the same way that it affects other constituents of urine, in that it regulates the amount of water in the urine. More ADH would lead to less water in the urine, giving you a higher concentration of potassium, as well as higher concentrations of everything else.
397415_4	Reinforcement can be negative (punishment) or positive. If you do something wrong and get punished for it (ie. negative reinforcement), are you really going to want to do it again?
4298183_4	In other words, you wish to spam people. And not just any spam, but targeted spam.. . I suggest you find another way to advertise. If any directory did exist, the listed addresses on such a directory would already have been spammed to death. Sorry pal, but you came to late to that party.
1919494_1	We are all from Adam and Eve since they were the original humans.  Since they sinned it caused their children to be born with sin.  Every human is therefore born with sin.  We're not accountable for their sins exactly, only our own.  The only person who never sinned was Jesus Christ.  Everyone sinned in some way.
3499881_0	Because he knows what he's talking about and is very good at what he does.
3499881_1	It's his disregard for political correctness, and the fact that he is a bloody good chef!!
3499881_2	People appreciate his passion for the food.  It is his way of making sure that no one dares make a mistake in the kitchen.  I truly believe that any chef who has trained under Gordon will be better for it.
3499881_3	As a top chef he demands high standards from his staff, if they can't take the heat get out of the kitchen. . It's about his own high standards, nothing to do with bullying, all chefs are the same, that's the nature of the job.
3499881_4	No, he is praised for his excellent chefing ability. His swearing and bullying is comman place in kitchens up and down the country and around the world. It is the same with everything today on television- If you dont like it dont watch it.. . I personally take his personality with a pinch of salt!
3499881_5	He's got charisma. That's why he can get away with the stuff he does. I think he's pretty cool.
3499881_6	I think he is a great chef. He has charm and talent so thats what makes him quite endearing, I think he has the Simon Cowell Syndrome. The nastier he gets the more we like him.
3499881_7	Is he that popular? what little I have seen of him every second word is a swear word, if that makes him popular then it say's a lot about what is wrong in this country...the man is a cretin.
3499881_8	because he,s a good chef
3499881_9	because he's rock and roll
3499881_10	He isn't popular with me!  I don't understand why this is supposed to be entertainment.  If he does this in his restaurant in real life it is surprising that he hasn't ended up in employment tribunials / court for his behaviour.
3499881_11	He has to be forceful in his work or he wouldn't be as successful as he is; his team all know and respect this and earn a lot of money. Why have people in the UK turned into such wimps? . . Gordon Ramsey is what I would call a real man
3499881_12	I certainly don't think he deserves praise of any sort and completely agree that his attitude and behaviour set an appalling role model for the young..  As a country we seem to enjoy watching ever increasing extreme behaviour (I'm thinking of some of the antics on Big Brother and other so called Reality TV shows) and worry this is the worst sort of voyeurism.
3499881_13	I have no idea as i find him arrogant and short of vocabulary hence the f word every 2 seconds and as for his programme its a switch off, flash in the pan  no pun intended
3499881_14	i think hes pretty ugly too, i cant see what the attraction is
3499881_15	I agree with you, I watched once and had to turn off, swearing is ok (marginally) in certain programmes, but certainly not in a kitchen. He's awful.
3499881_16	Is he popular?  I don't know of anyone who watches his programmes.  Tell you what though his much vaunted boxes of chocolates are tasteless, which pretty much applies to him as well.
3499881_17	Because he has lines on his chin
3499881_18	who?
3499881_19	He is a perfectionist and he only swears at those who think they're as good as him (or god forbid think they know better). All chefs are moody and mean tempered when they're working in the kitchen but they're charming as hell out of it. Artistic temperament I guess. He gets results and thats all he's interested in - he's not out to win popularity contests and the man deserves respect!
3499881_20	Because he used to play for Glasgow Rangers ...
3499881_21	Because he swears and is a bully
2472054_1	my dog messed with a skunk once and smelled bad after. I poured tomatoe juice on him and then washed him. It seemed to work.
2472054_2	There are products available at pet stores to deal with skunk odor.  I only ever had one animal (dog) get skunked.  There is an old home treatment that works as well as those things you buy and that is tomato juice.  Kind of messy.  You have to literally soak your animal with the tomato juice, give it a few minutes, and then shampoo out the tomato juice.  It worked that time.
2472054_4	Use hydrogen peroxide. It changes the molecules of the skunk spray.
3552514_5	go to the nearest pet store (such as petsmart) and get a toothbrush, toothpaste for dogs not humans, and maybe some chewies that help bad breath and brush them every other night or every night that works for my lil pug. and remember for dogs not humans and i would suggest getting the finger brush the ones u can slide on ur finger and brush those work best

1671103_0	I don't know. I seem to be punished on this site all the time for saying I don't know a thing when I don't. I'm just being honest.
1671103_5	Silly question.  People are punished for all kinds of unjust reasons.  It's like asking why do bad things happen to good people or something.
1653261_1	Yes, when you have an echo, or any other study, a doctor will always look at the results (or should always, anyway).  In addition, in order to bill (and we doctor do enjoy being paid for our work) the doctor must be board certified with echos, which means a cardiologist.
3095127_4	if that person is twiching his eyelids then he is in a stage of sleep. sleep has 4 stages. one stage is deep sleep. in this stage the person enters deep sleep. but before this stage is called the REM stage or RAPID EYE MOVEMENT STAGE.in this stage the person's eyelids move rapidly . it is betwwen DEEP SLEEP STAGE and the light SLEEP stage. . but if that person's entire body shakes then it could be different. sometimes children shakes in their sleep when they hear loud noises. a grownup who shakes in his sleep could mean that he is scared .sometimes when you have ILECTROLITE IMBALANCE, then a person shakes when he lies down. this can be cured by saline water.it could also mean a very bad nightmare. like night terror or gas. if you have gas, you will twist and turn in sleep. try to go to a doc.if its night terror then that person has some deep secrets which is bothering hm a lot . you have to see all theses symptoms in the net to make a proper diagnosis.
604564_6	Because smokers have rights too ... smoking is legal and people have a right to make their own decisions even if it is bad for them.  If the government were to ban everything that's bad for people then you have to ban fast food too because that will clog your arteries and give you a heart attack if you have too much.  Cigarettes are the same sort of thing.. . As for second hand smoke, it's all about ventilation.  Outdoors smoke dissipates, the outdoors is a natural ventilation system.  Indoors, they can put in ventilation systems that cut down on second hand smoke.  Because places like bars and restaurants are public but are also business owner's private businesses, those business owners should be allowed to decide whether or not they want to allow smoking in their business.  If an owner decides to allow smoking, then people that are paranoid that the guy smoking a cigarette with his beer is going to give them lung cancer can go somewhere else.  People should all have choices.. . Smoking bans are really a kind of tyranny imposed on smokers by the non-smoking majority.  While they might not approve of smoking, banning it is really rather cruel.  It's as if you were thirsty and had a bottle of water but were told by the government you weren't allowed to drink it.. . The last thing I'm going to tell you is creating a smoking ban is pointless if you don't enforce it.  That means you need to create a smoking police and a system to punish smokers.  That costs money and is a questionable priority given that there are murderers on the loose.
2076630_0	Nurse practitioners generally have a Masters degree and extra training in a specialty area...like obstetrics or pediatrics.  They can do more extensive physical exams, order treatments and medications, and supervise the R.N.s giving patient care.  They work under the supervision of a physician.  If you are thinking of a career, call a local hospital and see if they can refer you to one to interview.  Many also work with doctors in their offices and some have independent practices.  They are licensed by the state.  Hope this helps.
635857_6	Jet engines are more reliable and need less maintenance.. . Jet engines are effective at high altitude (so planes can fly above the weather).. . Jet engines are more powerful (so planes can be bigger and faster).. . The result is that jet planes can carry bigger loads at faster speeds, avoiding bad weather, and rarely stopping for breakdowns or maintenance.. . (Propellor planes are cheaper and more efficient and are still used for very short commercial flights. And also long flights -- the Voyager plane that flew around the world without stopping was propellor driven -- but it had to fly through the weather)

3206998_0	They use a diluted soap-based foam blown onto Main street continuously.  If you get a 'snowflake' on your tongue, you can taste the soap.  It's highly diluted so the soap doesn't accumulate and make the sidewalks slippery before the hose-down crew can wash it off overnight.. . Looks cool, though, doesn't it!

3206998_5	It's these little icey-type peices. They make it cold and when it comes out of the shooter, it creates the illusion of snow. Geez, that was a terrible description....ok, I know what they are but it is just tough to describe.
3206998_6	umm a snow machine
3206998_7	Well, why is Disney the most happiest place on earth????. . They just are. Just like the snowflakes just are. I was so excited to see it snow there for the first time...too bad the little girl next me kept her mouth and eyes wide open when a HUGE puff of snowflakes went in her face.. . Her eyes were RED and nearly choked on the bubble snowflakes.. . Killed half of the magic right there but was still sorta magical.
3206998_8	they use fake snow!
3206998_9	Well, I dont know about DisneyLAND, but on Disney Channel, they use peices of chopped up potatoes! Id hate for potatoes to land on me when Im trying to act in a movie.
3206998_10	omg when i went there it done that snow thing at the end, its cool hey, i think its just bubble stuff coming out of the lightposts. but i was sad coz i never got to go on the teacup ride damnit

3753240_0	This web page has the symptoms of strep throat:. . http://www.webmd.com/hw/strep_throat/hw54784.asp. . it does not include one symptom:  just feeling really really yucky and ill, like you just want to go home and sleep through it.  I had it once.  I thought it was the worst day of my life, but that yucky feeling passes in about a day, but the sore throat remains.  Also, when you swallow, you definately feel discomfort and minor pain and feel that there is an infection in there.
3753240_1	Sore throat, low-grade fever, swollen lymphnodes...also you do not have to do a strep test to know. Clinical strep can be diagnosed by having a pinkish-red throat, low-grade fever and and a strawberry patch like rash under the arms or on the chest. If your throat is pinkish-red and no other symptoms then it is pharyngitis which can be viral or bacterial as well as strep and where the strep test is not as important as a cbd to determine what medicines would actually alleviate your symptoms.. . Dr. Cash
3753240_2	The most common symptoms of strep throat are a sudden, severe sore throat; pain or difficulty swallowing; fever over 101° (38.3°); swollen tonsils and lymph nodes; and white or yellow spots on the back of a bright red throat. Strep infection may also cause a headache and abdominal pain. Less commonly, strep throat can cause a red skin rash, vomiting, loss of appetite, and a general feeling of discomfort or illness.

89648_9	Life, liberty and the persuit of happiness. The American dream has meant many things for many people through out our history. Some came from other countries for religious freedom, others to escape tyranny.  Most came with the hope of a better life for them and their children.  Alot of people today believe that their dream is to succeed in their jobs. Some think that living safely without the threat of the government taking over their lives.  But mostly I think it is the freedom to persue whatever you want from life - be it a family, a home, a good job.  That's what people want. Freedom to live thier lives as they choose.

1586363_10	Because, according to the Imams, women are the "tools of Satan," leading men astray.  Of course they need to be covered from head to toe - anything else might cause a man to sin!  CAUSING a man to sin is a much bigger sin than the man actually sinning - which is why when a woman causes a man to sin, you can just stone her to death (or burn her).
652392_3	Typically when a car only heats up at an idle or in traffic, that's usually caused by the electric cooling fan not working. The water could be lost when it heats up in traffic. If a headgasket is suspected, take off the radiator cap when the engine is cool and start the car and watch for bubbles. Typically if a head gasket is blown you have lots of white smoke from the exhaust also.

The Carbon and 3 Oxygen atoms in the carbonate ion are held together by covalent forces.  The Ca ion and Carbonate ion are held together ionic (charge) attraction. Hope that helps a bit more.

1944018_0	Most lack maturity to make properly informed decisions. As do many adults.
1944018_1	They can vote: 18, 19.
1944018_2	It's is a right, responsibility, and a privilege reserved for legal adults only at this time.  Some high schools hold a mock election though.  You could suggest having one to someone at your school office.
1944018_3	Cause They Still Dont Have The Proper Sense To Judge A Person, Just By His/Her Campaign Speech.. Its The Same Reason Why They Aint Allowed To Drink
1944018_4	Teens can vote. When they're 18 and 19. . . Teens still have ALOT to learn. There is nothing wrong or demeaning about this. Even most ADULTS have alot to learn about politics. They go into a voting booth having no idea what party stands for what, or what candidate believes in what, and vote Democrat when their beliefs are Republican, or vote Republican when their beliefs are Democrat.
1944018_5	their lack of desire/ability to find and decifer the non-parisan truth.
1944018_6	I agree with debidel, the voting age should be raised.. Maybe then we would appreciate it enough to look at all sides of an issue before choosing. . I also think participation would go up to 99.9%.
1944018_7	In elections?  Because it's a widely held opinion that their brains are not yet developed fully.  (No, I'm not kidding, and please don't take offense.)
1944018_8	18 and 19 year old teens can vote... however I do not think they should be allowed until age 21 (like drinking), with the stipulation that they could vote at age 18+ if and only if they are active duty military..... . IMHO teens do not have the judgement skills or wisdom to vote... as experienced too much on here when teens participate in the political questions
1944018_9	at 18 you can, but you'll be suprised just how much real world knowledge you'll gain between 17-25! I do think if any one enlists in the military they should be allowed to drink and vote
1944018_10	When the founding fathers began drawing up the country, they wanted to formulate a republic more than a democracy. In a democracy, as in the time of ancient Greece, everyone had a say and could stand up and speak for themselves during large meetings. In an entire country, rather than just a city state, this idea is impossible and impractical. Therefore they developed a system of people voting in order say who they wanted to represent their best intrests. The founding fathers, though, where white protestant males of upper and middle class status, and thus feared the what they considered to be the uneducated and uninformed masses. That is why they developed the electoral college, so that even if a candiate won the popular vote, they would not necessarily become president. If the founding fathers feared the views of adults of their own time, they would certainly not have approved of the views of their youth, or today's youth for that matter. That is why teenagers cannot vote.
1944018_11	Because they don't know enough about life to make proper decisions on who should run the country.  I think you should be 21 to vote like it used to be...I think even 18 is too young.
1944018_12	They can, but only if they're over eighteen.. The reason for that is that most people under the age of eighteen AREN'T responsible enough OR informed enough to be trusted with such a responsibility.. Personally, I don't think a person should be able to vote at eighteen, or even 21.  I think thirty would be a good age....even if it does mean that I'd have to wait five more years to vote!
1944018_13	I guess the initial thinking was teenagers arent rational and cant be trusted on choosing our nations leaders.  Its up to you if you believe that or not.
1944018_14	BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO YOUNG (GENERALLY SPEAKING) AND NOT SLY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND POLITICS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO BUSY COPING WITH THEIR OWN DEVELOPEMENT AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO GIVE MUCH ATTENTION TO WIDER PERSPECTIVES AND ISSUES..P.S. QUEEN...HELLO!!! THAT WOULD BE EIGHT    TEEN!!!!
1944018_15	The reason is because to vote is an adult decision and until your 18 your legally not an adult. However I do think that the voting age should be 16 rather than 18. Many people start their first real jobs at around 16 and that means they are paying income taxes. If 16 year olds can be considered adult enough to pay income tax than I think they should be allowed to vote.
1944018_16	If a person pays taxes they should have the right to vote.. . On the other hand, a person that pays NO tax should not have the right to vote.. . To vote a person should be required to show up with their last pay stub along with a a picture ID. . . Sure would change things.
1944018_17	because they don't work, they don't pay taxes, they live with their parents and are not considered mature enough to form their own opinion..... . by the way judging from what adults have voted recently i say give voting rights to animals too, they tend to have better instincts and see through the BS.
1944018_18	the age to vote is 18 and teens are not 18 yet
1944018_19	well they can but only on a few things :(
1944018_20	They really should bring that age down to 16. Nowadays teens are more aware of issues, and can even drive a car, and quit school by that age. So, make them responsible to vote.
1944018_21	they think we are dummies and with that photo of yours, you kind of prove it. okay now i am being mean. so let me give you another explanation. see,if we could vote,then they have to increase the drinking age but adults are greedy so they don't want to share and since we call them greedy they call us dummies and they don't share anything with us.. someone is mean and ugly and i know it is not me.(just kidding)
1944018_22	kids cant vote cuase there to young to understand politics. they belive what other people tell them and not look at the facts. kids just dont understand
1944018_23	i think that teens can vote after 18. as 18 & 19 comes in teen.
1944018_24	uhhhh.....they can.  The Constitution states that any American citizen can vote when they turn 18.  EightTEEN and nineTEEN year olds can vote.
1944018_25	Teens can vote at 18&19, but otherwise most teenagers don't realize how important the election is. You see, most candidate discuss topics that we as young teenagers really don't understand or even care about. For instance, when a candidate is currently in office and is running again, typically they will claim to lower taxes but how would we, as teens, know if he went through with this?? We wouldn't because we don't have to pay the bills. At the age of 18 a teen is typically in college and so they are paying their own taxes so they know whether or not the candidate did indeed go through with the tax cut.

3759973_9	Most alcohol has an acquired tasted.  Most people drink not because they like the taste of it, except for beer, but for how it makes them feel after.  Take it from a recovering alcoholic of 15 years, you don't drink because it tastes good, you drink because you are addicted to it.  Why do people drink alcohol?  To get lucky, why else?  "Sherman's Lounge - Helping Ugly People Get Lucky For 35 Years"  T-shirt from Sherman's Lounge Flint, MI
3759973_13	It's just like saying. Why do some people like Sprite or Pepsi or Dr Pepper (ewwww- Dr Pepper)?. Or . Why do some people prefer Coke over Pepsi or 7-up over Sprite?. Or. Why do some people put ketchup on a hot dog and some would think that ruins that hot dog?. . Everyone acquires different tastes for things.  Me- I  only drink Miller Lite beer, white wines or vodka drinks.  I don't like the taste of anything else.  I don't think you aquire these tastes until you are older- so I think younger kids drink to be cool.. . Some people like the taste in moderation and have a glass or two.  Some people drink it more often as the beverage of choice.  Some people will drink a lot when they are going out to have fun with friends - just to let loose.  . . Hope that helps- take care!
3759973_15	Most people like the feeling they get after drinking.  Personally, I enjoy the taste of some beers and alcoholic drinks, but they are acquired tastes.  I'm not really showing off, I'm 24 and have the right to drink if I want, but younger kids and 21-year-olds usually drink to get drunk.
3759973_19	That's actually four questions, and I'll go throught them one by one.. . Why do people enjoy alchohol/beer?.      It affects their brains.  While alcohol is a depressant, what it first affects is their inhibitions; people are more likely to perform acts that they may not usually do - like many people have mentioned, attempt a sexual encounter, or perform daredevil-type stunts.. . It taste bitter, why do people like to drink?.     Not all alcohols taste bitter - ice wine, for example, tastes almost syropy, and the alcohol taste is non-existant.  Beers are bitter because of the hops, a bitter vegetable part (I forget if it's a flower or some other part).  Alcohol is very disagreeable (to me), but it's usually the other flavours that make it worthwhile.. . Are they just showing off?.      Not at first.... see answer one for details.. . Or do they truely enjoy it?.      I like the taste of the alcoholic beverages, like beers, scotches, and whiskeys.  Some people will put up with the taste just to get to the 'drunken' state.  I have never understood why blacking out is so much fun, especially if you cannot remember it, but there are people like that, and in North America, that is their right.
3759973_26	I think they just enjoy the taste,as some alchohol or beer is nice to drink!

311770_0	hi monu. . u said that when u study , dear it is up to you when u have the time to study or when u need to study. I think  u r not in intersted in studying or u hava any problem with any subject that why u could not concentrate on ur study so when u want to study make interest on that subject learn with interest & one thing more that when u sit to study keep yr mind fresh / blank from ur  routine & never think about it at the time of study. And always sit alone from ur family environment becoz it disturbed u or crupt ur concentration. keep it up dear u got success. . . Never think that study is a burden for u that's the reson of concentration not come to u
311770_1	you mean you cant concentrate?First,you have to focus on what you are studying...Dont mix study with other stuff in your head.,and sometimes when you got a headache take a pause because you will not be able to learn on what you're studying...I usually study at dawn..i slept early and then wake up at 2am and i can concentrate already because i was able to rest my brain....my memory... Take care...
311770_2	just like and enjoy the work you do, concentration will come automatically
311770_3	We have to put our mind into whatever we do 'cause take this instance for example. If u r sitting to study and u r thinking of ur favourite TV program u r better of watching TV  than doing the thing u r struggling to do in ur mind.. . U must be fcused in what u want to do that is all concentrating is about.
311770_5	when u want to achieve something in life concentration is more necessary, first of all u should determine what u want to be. doctor, engineer,etc. then concentrate on u r present course, if u complete the days work it will be easy for u to get good marks. if u get good marks in one exam that gives u more confidence and u try to start reading continuously, nothing succedes success like success, secondly y ur parents might have hopes on u that u will settle in good position thereby they will get name and fame, hence u have to concentrate on u r studies, and u will be recognised by all ,
1136677_4	The Constitution set the term for a Congressman at 2 years so every two years, the whole House must be re-elected.  Senators serve for 6 years and their elections were split into thirds so 1/3 of the Senators has to run every two years.  It helps to keep a balance between stable administration and allow the people to express their concerns on a regular basis.

2815090_0	Cloning has happened...  There was a company that cloned cats..  They charged 50,000.00 dollars a pop to clone a dead cat..  Then they lowered the price to 30,000.00 because they didn't get a lot of business.  Then the Humaine Society put them out of business and said there were too many little animals that needed a home to clone old dead pets...The first cloned kitty was named copy cat...  Learn this stuff because it's a great thinking question..  You would provide the best answer cause it's your grade and not ours.. We could care less if you flunked it...
2815090_1	i dont see any reason why we would just start cloning everybody in the community, earth is already overcrowded.  personally i dont think we will ever clone more than a few people, because there are no reasons to, and many people disapprove of it in the first place.  maybe you should write about how it wont happen to every kids on the block. p.s. if you dont like my answer, just say "it would cause a lot of contraversey and mixed emotions" or something like that
2815090_2	The purpose of a question like this is for YOU to take what YOU know about cloning (and for YOU to do research about it) and then for YOU to extrapolate from what YOU know to what YOU think might happen.. . Try watching (or reading) The Island. Just one grim outlook of many about cloning.

4256593_4	no no no....like others said, cdma service doesnt have sim cards, ie sprint and verizone while gsm carriers do, ie cingular and tmobile.  Sim card is where you "activation" and numbers are stored.  With gsm you just take the sim card out, put in another gsm phone and you are off and running.  The drawback with cdma is you have to call your carrier to transfer service from phone to phone.

4190287_2	it is so hard to switch schools because u may have so many friends maby u r the most loved person maby u have a boyfriend!. u will have to let all your teachers go. most of all u may never make friends in the other school like the ones u have allready
4190287_3	Switching schools is depressing because you have to start from the  beginning to get to know students, teachers, administrators with their quirks, attitudes and routines.. . Nothing is done the way you are use to it being done. You are always being corrected. No one wants to hear how you did it back, where-you-came-from!. . You are the new kid in school, class, town or perhaps heaven forbid all  of the above. Some people have very limited lives and that makes them overly interested in yours until someone new walks onto their little stage. Meanwhile you may feel like the new class hamster that bites off it's new babies heads because the children won't stop poking, prodding, picking and touching.. . You'll make friends, move back to where-you-came-from, (It won't be the same.) become one of them and someone else will become the class hamster.. . Meanwhile, smile, be polite, don't scream or cry, this to shall pass.
4190287_4	It doesn't have to be.  My son switched schools this year.  It was a challenge for a couple of weeks, but it has turned out to be one of the best things that has happened to him..       I wish you the best  - Kevin

4190287_7	Because you are leaving all of your friends behind. You also need to make more friends, and you are new so people treat you a lot differently. I know it's hard! Sorry...
4190287_8	because you feel exposed to ridicule and you have to make new friends all over again
4190287_9	It's because you have to leave your friends behind and adjusting to a new environment like teachers and other students.  It can be frightening, sometimes  It may take awhile and it may feel aggravating.  As time passes you'll get used to the new school.

1794677_2	There are two types of acne scar, the first one is caused by an increase in tissue formation, and the second type of acne scar is caused by a loss of tissue.. . An acne scar caused by an increase in tissue formation is a hypertrophic scar and is associated with excessive amounts of collagen.. . Overproduction of collagen is associated with injury to the skin. It is a direct response of the skin to injury. Excessive collagen forms fibrous masses which results in typical acne scar.. . A drug recommended by many dermatologists for the worst cases of acne scars is Accutane. It is the wonder drug of the 21st century to prevent acne scarring in acne sufferers.. . Accutane is a very controversial drug to use as it can cause birth defects. Doctors caution that you should always check whether you're pregnant or liable to be pregnant before commencing a course.
1794677_3	well, you may never get rid of them completely, but Vitamin E helps heal scars. and the newer the scar, the better chance of it going away. try Mederma, or another Vitamin E cream. i got hit by an elbow in cheerleading just above my eyebrow and had to get stitches so i had a scar there and i've been using Mederma on it and it seems to be helping. i also tore my achilles tendon a few years back (damn cheerleading! lol) which i had to get surgery for and i used Mederma on that too. it was a pretty big scar and you can hardly even see it now. make sure to put it on every day though.

3239329_0	Because in the summer, we lose a lot of sweat yes? =] so, this sweat has to be replaced with water from the body, meaning why we drink more in the summer, BUT, in the winter, we hardly sweat, meaning a build up of water, and bingo, out it comes, its all homeostasis, blood and body temperatures =], Basically, the water in our body cant escape  through the sweat glands, well, cus its winter, meaning it just builds up and puts everything out of balance. So we pee more. In the summer we dont pee asmuch cus water is lost through sweat.
3239329_1	When you go outdoors into the cold, for example, when leaving the pub at the end of the night, for the long walk home, the sudden change in temperature causing vasconstriction. This is a subconscious tighening of veins to reduce the loss of heat through the skin. A byproduct of this is pressure being put upon the bladder,so we need to wee.

3239329_4	well i think the reason why we have colder weather at night is because the sun has gone!
3239329_5	Speak for yourself!
3239329_6	hot temperatures mean we need more fluids in our body to compensate for external loss,e.g sweating.in cold weather unnecessary fluids become a liability,the body uses energy to keep them warm for no benefit,so it expels them.more prominent at night when body temp.drops when sleeping so it gets rid of unnecessary fluids.
3239329_7	when the weather is cold, you use considerably less fluid cooling the body for temperature regulation, moisture lost through respiration and sweating etc. . thus you urinate a lot more
3239329_8	lol think its because you drink more hot drinks to try and keep warm.. cause in the summer you drink more but lose a lot of water through the skin

3860232_0	Standard Deviation, a number representing how closely bunched a set of numbers is around its mean, or average value. The standard deviation is an important concept in statistics because it is a precise indicator of the degree of variability within a set of numbers. A set with a smaller standard deviation consists of more closely bunched numbers than a set with a larger standard deviation. If the test scores of a class were 76, 80, 82, 85, and 91, for example, the standard deviation would be about 5.04, reflecting the fact that the scores are fairly close together. A class with the wildly varying test scores 0, 53, 77, 91, and 100, however, would have a standard deviation of about 35.8.. . The standard deviation of a set of numbers is calculated using the deviation of individual numbers from the set’s mean. Each deviation is found by subtracting the number from the mean. If there are n members in a set and the deviations of the members from the mean are symbolized by x1 through xn, the standard deviation (σ) is given by the formula: .  . . . To compute the standard deviation of the set {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, for example, first find the mean. The mean is the sum of all the members of a set divided by the number of members of the set: (2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 9)/5 = 25/5 = 5. The individual deviations from the mean are 5 – 2 = 3, 5 – 3 = 2, 5 – 5 = 0, 5 – 6 = -1, and 5 - 9 = -4. Square the individual deviations and add them together: 32 + 22 + 02 + (-1)2 + (-4)2 = 9 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 16 = 30. Divide the result by the number of members of the set: 30/5 = 6. Take the square root and round to two decimal places: √6 = 2.45. The standard deviation of {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, therefore, is 2.45.. . This equation works for sets in which all members are specified. A more complex equation is necessary to determine the standard deviation of a set using only a sample of that set’s elements.. . OR:. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of dispersion: a statistical measure of the amount by which a set of values differs from the arithmetical mean, equal to the square root of the mean of the differences' squares
3860232_1	Standard deviation tells us how far from the mean the data points tend to be.. . For example, if the mean is 20 and SD is 5. Then all the numbers used to calculate the average (20) can be 5 standard deviation away from it. So the numbers can be from anywhere of 15-25.

3832839_12	Contrary to popular belief, it's got nothing to do with drying out. . . In short, osmotic pressure forces water into your finger's cells, which causes them to expand. In order to accomodate the extra cellular mass, the skin has to fold a little bit to make room for the cell's expansion.

2503069_1	It is the same in all cities which had the bulk of their growth after WWII; the age of the automobile and suburban sprawl.  . . If you want good public transport in the US move to a 19th century city like NY, Boston, Philly or San Francisco.
2787567_1	We all just need to weed out the answers that we don't like , because there is no way of weeding out the rude people . I never take anything on here personally .
2787567_4	Some of the people  asking questions are rude. The only reason they ask some these questions is to bash someone, degrade someone, or try to make someone angry.
80273_4	To preform well at a intelligence-test a basic ability needed is concentration. Lack of concentration is, together with other symptoms, a strong indicator of depression. So if you've got problem concentrating, you'll preform poor at a intelligence-test. There's no evidence saying that people who've got depression had poor intelligence before they got depression.
1844896_0	You could get a meat thermonmeter and pull the burgers off when they hit about 145 to 150 degrees F in the center.  (The time depends on how thick the burger is.)  Then you put them in a foil pouch to let them rest and let the juices re-distrubute for 5 to 7 minutes.  The temperture should increase by about 5 degrees while they rest, so food illness is decreased.
1844896_1	Angus is just a type of ground beef.  They cook the same way as hamburgers.  I would say maybe you don't want to cook them all the way through, but if you do, cook until the juices run clear.  I would say maybe about 4 mins on each side.  Make sure your flame is low, you don't want to char the outside of them before the inside is done.  And watch for flareups, if you cook until the fat runs out, it will flare up and give an off flavor to the burger.  Lastly, you could purchase a food thermometer...140 degrees for medium, and 165 for well done.  Good luck, and email me with any questions!. . OH YEAH!  One more thing...you don't have to make a 'test' burger, you could always just crack it open a little to see the inside, and then serve crack side down on the bun!
1844896_2	Angus is just hamburger, there's nothing special about it.
1844896_3	If cooking on the bar-b-q cook on one side until blood appears, turn over wait until juices run clear. Do not keep turning.
1844896_4	I usually cook burgers until they quit bleeding on both sides, then maybe just a little longer. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the burger.

4344565_1	Daewoo Motor Company in Korea was placed under the control of the Korean bankruptcy courts in late 2000.. . In 2002 a new company, GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology was created, part owned by Daewoo Motor Company's creditor banks, part owned by GM-Holden (the Australian arm of General Motors), part owned by Suzuki and part owned by Shanghai Automotive Industries Corporation. This company took over two of the three Daewoo Motor factories in Korea, plus one in Vietnam, and the Bupyong Technical Center, and did a deal to continue to buy cars from the other factory (also at Bupyong) in Korea. It has since bought the Bupyong factory too.. The European distribution system for Daewoo was dismantled, and a new one created by GM-Europe.. . The cars are now badged Chevrolet for most export markets including Europe (although Suzuki, Pontiac, Buick and Holden badges are used on certain models in some other countries). The Daewoo name is still used in Korea.. . So, to answer your question, the company is not Chevrolet but, in Europe, its cars are Chevrolets.. . See . http://wikicars.org/en/Daewoo. http://www.gmdaewoo.co.kr/kor/index.jsp. http://www.chevroleteurope.com/

2028407_0	Don't think about concentrating.  If you think about what might be distracting you, then you're being distracted.. . A good way to concentrate while studying is to not worry about concentrating.
2028407_5	You have to really want to learn whatever it is you're studying. I know when I hate a subject I'm studying, no matter what I do, I just won't be able to study it well. . . Think of all the reasons why you're studying and why you want to do well. It could be having good grades could help you achieve your future ambitions. Or it could be you want to impress someone. Doesn't matter as long as it works.. . If you can motivate yourself and feel good about studying, you'll enjoy doing it and then you won't need to worry about how to concentrate. It'll come naturally!

1800604_1	in my line of work i see many Filipinos. My answer may sound judgemental but im kind of pushing my thoughts based on what i see, and jokes they say amongst themselves. . by the way i work at a funeral home.. Filipinos are generally friendly at first, but also very judgemental, materialistic and self centered.. They are very open to filipinos but anyone else closed off. . In funerals they are very supportive as a community, often showing up wether they know the deceased or not. This sometimes seems nice, but on many occasions they do not enter the chapel, they just stand around outside, drink coffee and socialize. . Many of the funerals i attended were for young men. They apperently are very much into driving fast. many of them arent too good at it. . They also use funerals as a way of showcasing their talents. Anyone who thinks they can sing often sings a few songs. . . Its hard to think of many positives, i mostly heard negatives, and mostly from other filipinos.
403104_1	All materials at temperatures above absolute zero have some resistance to the flow or movement of electrons through the material, even the materials that compose the battery. All materials are swimming pools of electrons and nuclei that get in the way of the electrons traveling from one end of the battery to the other, and since the positive end of the battery is taking in electrons all the time, and the negitive end is pouring out electrons all the time, there must be electrons traveling in the battery from the positive end to the negative end, each one dodging the structural crowd of electrons and nuclei that make up the battery (the material of the battery).
2276319_16	most animals do see in black and white...but thats because there eyes dont have color receptors like ours. The reason we see color is not only because of our eyes but because light bounces of things. Let me explain....We know that sun light has the full spectrum of visible light....Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet.When light bounces of a leaf(lets say) we seen the color green. The reason why this happens is because the green spectrum of the sun light is reflected back to us while all the other colors are absorbed by the leaf.There for...dont worry....our wonderfull universe does have color.
2220192_6	The word "passion" is from a Latin word which means "suffering".  From that word we also get our word "patient" ("suffering one").
596426_6	Ok Violent games for one.Games do not make kids violent the parents do.For example the Bully that was supposed to be a big hit among parents as far as bashing goes.The Bully if anything makes kids respect other kids because the whole game you are protecting the weaker kids.Mortal Kombat that is the first bloody game people have ever saw look up violence from that game you will not see any kids trying to ''rip out people spines'' and so forth.Grand Theft Auto to tell you what I believe that shows you kids what will happen if this stuff happens or they do this stuff.As far as ''game violence''goes it is ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS up to the parents.The parents decide if their kids get these game now a days.If you are under 17 you cannot get a ''M'' mature rated game.If the parents get the game that is their fault not the kids.There I wrote your report you pretty much.Use it as you wish.

4167106_1	I never heard of a minor being put on house arrest, but guess that's possible.  Usually you get probation some community service or they could send you off to a juvenile detention center for awhile, maybe even put a curfew on you.  Depends on the Judge really.
4271164_0	Registering as a Jew in Hitler's Europe was dangerous. Once counted, forever hunted. Hitler counted each one in each country and kept a running tally of the number executed and the remaining number alive. He got updates daily from his underlings on headcount. Truly frightening times. The ones who got away had help from non-Jews and an underground network. Fake IDs and passports were used. .

3348959_1	The emotional pain that comes with clinical depression can be so intense that it makes living a torture chamber. In addition, the depression also triggers very high anxiety that is equally unbearable. I would equate the pain with being burned alive. People who suffer from extreme depression are looking to die to escape the psychic pain. It has nothing to do with whether you value your life or not. Once the neurotransmitters start malfunctioning to a severe extent, living is hell on earth. There are many great sites on the Internet that explain this in depth.

2226616_8	My old house was overrun with mice. We tried everything: taps, human and non-human, bait and hand-catch. They breed really fast.. . The best one so far has been a simple humane trap.. . Get a small garbage can (the rim reaching over a foot and a half) and place at the bottom food (many like gain, some liked uncooked noodles, some like peanut butter) and place the can where a mouse could jump in (by a table, chair, were wired are. Wait a few days. We caught well over 50 mice (no lie, really) this way!

275850_8	Knowledge is factual information, things you learn. It is part of intelligence, but not the only facet of it.. . If you go with the theory that intelligence can be divided into crystal and fluid intelligence... crystal encompasses the knowledge (facts, information, recall, etc). Fluid intelligence is application, adaptation, and problem solving. . . The Wechsler scales look at a lot of different areas in determining IQ, they divide it into verbal and performance scores, and these are derived from several subtests, which also include processing speed, retention, and others. . . Here is a decent summary of the WAIS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale
275850_12	Knowledge is data.  Intelligence is processing speed.
275850_13	Knowledge is data, and intelligence is needed to use and manipulate it.. An encyclopedia has a lot of knowledge and no intelligence.
275850_15	I think they go hand in hand. Intelligence is ability, but its useless without knowledge, which is learned. Knowledge isnt possible without intelligence.
1152934_0	Because I have to lift up your bag, not you.  And people of size might have to pay for an extra seat if they don't fit in one.

What if you end up being fat?!?. . . i hope you do so then people can make fun of you for it!!!!. . . grrrrr i HATE you and i don't even like you
1152934_4	I do know that certain airlines do require people over certain size limits to purchase two seats. Not to be mean, but most economy class seats are small for an average person, and if you can't fit, you just can't fit. It's probably a traveler's nightmare to have an overly large person seated next to them, and taking a portion of the already cramped space you have. But, look on bright side, if you have to buy two seats, you should get two meals.
1152934_5	There have been cases where a person is so obese that they require 2 seats and have been charged for 2 seats.
1152934_6	I don't know but as a small, light person I think it should be done on weight. Parcels are charged by weight so for us light people they should either charge us less, or allow us to bring more carry on luggage - it's only fair!! (and yes I'm serious).
1152934_7	Fat people do pay extra for air travel, they have to pay for the extra seat they take up.

1199639_1	You might think about trying this book called "The Movie Star Diet" by Steve Simmons. It helped me lose thirty pounds in 2 1/2 months when I didn't think anything would work. My goal to begin with was only 20 lbs! It has a really easy plan to follow and an excellent workout as well.
1199639_2	As others have said, you need to have some fat on your body in order to live.  A healthy % of body fat for a woman is 20-25%.
1199639_3	weight traninning.
1199639_4	First, you can't lose all of your body fat. Fat is essential to cellular and organ function. It makes up cell membranes, protects organs and is a connective tissue for cells and organs. Plus it is your bodies storage system for nutrients. . Second, as the first answerer stated, trying to reduce your body fat too much will cause serious health problems. You said you are slim, so I would just continue to eat healthy and exercise and not worry about losing fat.
1199639_5	Hi,. I've tried all different diets, and the weight loss is only temporary. I finally tried diet pills on the market are made from Hoodia. I saw this stuff on ABC News. It's all natural and safe, and it works! My wife took it for a month and dropped 20 pounds. I took it for a month and lost about 13 (but I didn't exercise).. . I bought the natural hoodia from this website: http://www.alllsite.info/free-diet-pills.php . I checked the web site address so I can post it here and I saw they're running a promotion now to get a free 2 week sample for only $4.97! I'm going to order this supply for my wife and give it to her for Christmas =)
1199639_6	Trust me you cant' lose all of your body fat... as much as I hate knowing that it is the sad truth.... You have to have some "body fat" for all of your vital organs and things to perform properly - . . but with that said - to lose body fat you have to work out and burn more calories than you take in.
1199639_7	hahaha, the most trained people like light weigh boxers, have around 10-12% of body fat, getting less than that is practically imposible, to get to that 10-12% u'll need extreme exercise and extreme diet........ What you should do is lot of cardio and some lifting mixed with a good low fat diet with lot of protein and fiber, the muscles burn the fat, I don't mean big muscles, just muscles enough to have a firm body...... . Luck
1199639_8	If you have no fat on your body, then you'll be gross and bony and not even able to have a period.. . Women are supposed to be around 20% body fat.
1199639_9	I don't think you need to lose more fat. If you know someone who is fat tell them to try Nexagen USA's Jen Fe Next Fat Loss Patch. This stuff works on curbing your cravings and the ForsLean ingredient helps you lose the real FAT.  For testimonies go to www.nexagenusa.com/nsolorio  and for more product info as well.. .

1768249_5	Your turkey must be thawed before you cook it, and you should thaw your turkeys in the fridge.  They are large enough that if you try to cook them still partially frozen, they will not reach a safe temp internally. I copied some info for you:. . Thawing Your Turkey . .

2619912_5	I am happy that you found your "true Guru" (teacher) I found my teacher when I prayed directly to God with contrite heart,God please send me a teacher,he sent me  a saint from india,who baptised me in spirit,lifting me up into unconditional love,showing me that i was no longer a sinner or a child of God but that "God dwells within you as you", he taught the same things as jesus but with much more clarity.He caused mine eye to be "single" so that i can see God in all things.his name is Swami muktananda paramahamsa  his page is on the net.
2619912_6	There were a few things that led me to receiving Jesus as Lord and Savior. . One was that I was interested in a particular book on prophecy, so my husband suggested that to understand it better, I should read through the bible. Which I did.. . Also I heard an invitation to accept Jesus.Until then I didn't realize  my need for salvation.. . And the "clincher" was going to a bible study. My first one was called "Examine the Evidence". I learned how the bible was written by many different people, divinely inspired by God, from many different back grounds and locations and time periods. And that the bible was written over a long period of time. And despite all of  that, it is in perfect harmony from Genesis to Revelation.. . And I'm sure that having my saved sisters pray for me for many years had a lot to do with it too!!!. . Thank you for an opportunity to share. It is so cool that you came to know Yeshua the Messiah! Keep telling people about Him!. . And David - with no disrespect to "Names are much too..." You made the right decision and Jesus is the Messiah that the Jews have been waiting for. . here is link that may be helpful-. http://jewsforjesus.org/
271354_6	Christianity is the umbrella term for Catholicism and Protestant faiths. Of course this becomes difficult with the faith of the "Born Again Christians" who call themselves just Christians or True Christians.
143003_0	It means you're poor and can't afford food. It's from the Jefferson's theme song, right?
1987580_1	Put simply yes, If the crust of the earth under lake Erie where to rise or fall even just a few feet it could cause a Tasmania.  As you probably already know that is what caused the Tasmania on Christmas just a few years back, except that that earthquakee was so strong that it lifted the earth crust over 20 feet and caused a underwater land slide when that happened it caused a displacement of water,  So much that the water on one side of the quake caused the tide to rise, and on the other side of the quake the tide lowered that is the side that dose almost all the damage.  So Yes any earthquak underwater can and most likely will cause a tsunami of some kind.  I hope that this helps.
1955223_0	Because Saturn, as well as the Earth, is travelling at different speeds throughout it's elliptical orbit. Taking longer to move 1/2 of its orbit than the other half. . FYI, the Earth is furthest away from the Sun in January and the Earth is moving more slowly then. Closest to the sun in June, really moving then.. Hope this helps.
1955223_3	I suppose it is because Saturn is in an elliptical orbit. It speeds up and slows down as it orbits the Sun. That would mean that it could take less than half the time to go half way around the sun and more than half the time to go the rest of the way around the Sun back to the starting point.
3338514_7	i agree 100% people ask questions that they really need to know and people just go and answer something and put stupid answers like "i dont know" and if you dont know do answer!!!. . thanks you have a good weekend too!
1700886_18	I went to college and just wanted to sleep when I came home, now 1 1/2 years later, I have server ear problems along w/ existing issues of of depression and anxiety from childhood,marriage,ect.  Also, foreseen failure?
1864386_3	crusts moving :)
1168065_0	I  had braces when i was younger, and i always would drink cold drinks, and take Tylenol. that is really all that works. it only takes a few days to get over the hurt. like the last person said, you'll get used to it.
1606906_2	Usually you have a sore throat, mild fever and severe exhaustion!!!!. It has been nicknamed the kissing disease because alot of junior and high school students....it is very contagious!!! It also can last for weeks!!! A simple blood test will tell you if it is Mono!!! You can get it of course from kissing....sharing food or drinks, toothbrushes and so on!!!. It is caused by the same virus Strep throat comes from often times if strep throat is untreated it can progress to mononucleosis all by itself!!! So there it is it is  highly contagious strep infection....if you have it you really need to see a doctor and stay away from school or work.  Try not to go around people who have cancer or any other life threatening disease because it can make them fatally ill!!!
2722241_0	I think it's a holdover from when most animals were pack animals. They had an awareness of death being near, and didn't want scavenger animals drawn to where the pack was looking for the dead animal.  So to maintain the secrecy of the location of their den - the animal would leave to keep the pack safe.
2722241_1	it is because they do not want to see their masters upset before they enter the pearly gates they just want to remember you with a warm smile and all of the love that you gave them here on earth
2722241_2	they don't want people watching them in pain and staring while it is slowly dying. Your poor cat.... It wants a queit and loenly place to die, a place where no one can stare at it, talk about it, or point at it. The poor animal will do that... I am so sorry. Also, they don't want you to worry about him/her while she is in pain, that will make you in misery as well... i hope you feel better,
2722241_3	they want to be alone and they want to hide from anything that might hurt them
2722241_4	lol because they know they are going to die and want to make it more difficult for us. We have to find where the smell is coming from, move every furniture there is in the area to find it rotting away and more stinking then we have to place it in the garbage --sorry about ur cat hope he rest in peace
2722241_5	??maybe because it is quiet
2722241_6	ok...this is why... the cat was probably alone when he died. he/she probably wanted to die alone since he had no one to die with. and why you ask he wouldn't die with you? probably because your cat didnt feel that attached to you so he just decided to die alone.. sorry about the cat. :(
2722241_7	Maybe they don't want to be exposed to predators. I mean, if they are dying it would be horrible to be eaten alive while your dying anyway. I wouldn't want to be exposed to the world when I die either!
2722241_8	sorry to hear your cat died
2722241_9	well, like most animals including some people, cats don't want to be seen by other creatures when there at there weakest, if they get attacked when weak they won't be able to defend themselves.
2722241_10	that's a good question. I think they just want to be alone and on their own so as not to bother anyone. just like puppies when they're born the mother tries to find a place where no one will bother them
2722241_11	It didn't know it was going to die. It knew it was very ill so went to hide for protection.. . I notice our sheep do this as well, they go into the hedgerows.
2722241_12	Instinct tells a cat to hide where a predator can't find them.  When a cat is ill, it may think it is being stalked - so it hides.  Dogs do the same.  Cats are notorious for this behavior.
2722241_13	in the wild the animals die alone when a cat his wounded or about to die even though though they are now domestic they will revert back to the wild and die alone - I'm sorry you found your cat that way but in another way it is a kindness because when my cat was hit by a car he picked himself up and went into hiding even though he was hit outside our home - we never found him again but he is presumed dead because he was just 8 months and hit by a land rover
4022146_2	Just like everyone else. Actually no one that was hung at the witch trials was a witch. They were all falsely accused.
4022146_7	If you are thinking that they had gnarled faces with warts........YOU ARE SO WRONG.  They looked, and still look, the same as you and I.  Period dress may have changed, but faith is the same.  The witches of the 1600s they look, dressed, acted the same.  Although, few of them did live away from the rest of the town.  But if you are wanting to know what people wore in that era...I suggest you watch "The Crucible"...this is a movie..as well as a book...based on the accusations of the Salem Witch Trials.
1657326_1	Why let your cat outside? Cats are safer kept indoors. But I know I cannot change your mind about keeping your cat indoors...and changing a litterbox is better than letting your cat go potty outdoors, read some of the posts here on Answers about what some mean people would do to your cat if they happened to go potty in a cat-hater's yard!
2194174_1	Gee, I dunno, why should we bother to tell you.. . Leitch has a great Anthology out on this stuff.. . Butler and Sedgwick would be great selections to read from it to teach YOURSELF these concepts.... . You DO know that critical Theory is a VAST area to cover, right?. . . There is no one or 2 ontological tenets...there are 100s.... . . The scary thing is, you sound like an upper year College student. Why are you NOT reading this yourself???????
845711_0	Anxiety is nothing more than a feeling of apprehension and uncertainty. Believe it or not some anxiety is normal and healthy. Chronic, and continuous worry, however, is not. Everyone experiences some anxiety even on a daily basis but people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) experience constant anxiety which often has no apparent cause. GAD may be mild and manageable, but, for some people, it is debilitating. It can also cause and/or aggravate additional health problems, both physical and psychological.. . People with GAD often worry about the same problems everyone worries about - money, health, families, jobs, etc. The problem is, people with GAD worry excessively and constantly. People without GAD have the ability to put normal worries on hold and focus on daily activity. People with GAD are often distracted by their worries and find it difficult to think about anything else.. . Many people with GAD also feel constant anxiety with no apparent cause. They wake up feeling anxious and can never pinpoint a direct cause. The anxiety never seems to disappear throughout the day.. . "Unfortunately, most people with GAD assume that they are just a 'nervous person' and that nothing can be done. They do not usually seek treatment unless their anxiety is complicated by depression, panic attacks or alcoholism. With appropriate treatment, however, GAD sufferers can feel less anxious and function better." -- Deborah Cowley, MD, in Psychopharmacology. . The cause of GAD has yet to be determined, and there is probably more than one possible cause. GAD appears to run in families, so there is probably a genetic factor. A major traumatic or stressful event may sometimes trigger GAD. Another theory is that the person with GAD has internal conflicts which have yet to be resolved. GAD may begin in childhood or later in life. Most likely, GAD has both physiological and psychological components.. . Generalized anxiety disorder is a relatively common anxiety problem, affecting 3-4% of the population, that turns daily life into a state of worry, anxiety, and fear. Excessive thinking and dwelling on the "what ifs" characterizes this anxiety disorder. As a result, the person feels there’s no way out of the vicious cycle of anxiety and worry, and then becomes depressed about life and the state of anxiety they find themselves in.. . Generalized anxiety usually does not cause people to avoid situations, and there isn’t an element of a "panic attack" involved in the prognosis, either. It’s the thinking, thinking, thinking, dwelling, dwelling, ruminating, ruminating, and inability to shut the mind off that so incapacitates the person. At other times, thoughts seem almost non-existent because the anxious feelings are so dominant. Feelings of worry, dread, lack of energy, and a loss of interest in life are common. Many times there is no "trigger" or "cause" for these feelings and the person realizes these feelings are irrational. Nevertheless, the feelings are very real. At this point, there is no "energy" or "zest" in life and no desire to want to do much.. . This emotional fear and worry can be quite strong. If a loved one is ten minutes late, the person with generalized anxiety fears the very worst -- something’s dreadfully wrong (after all, they’re ten minutes late!), there’s been an accident, the paramedics are taking the person to the hospital and his injuries are just too critical to resuscitate him....."Oh, my God!.....WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?" Feelings of fear and anxiety rush in from these thoughts, and the vicious cycle of anxiety and depression runs wild.. . Some people with generalized anxiety have fluctuations in mood from hour to hour, whereas others have "good days" and "bad days". Others do better in the morning, and others find it easier at the end of the day. These anxiety feelings and moods feed on themselves, leading 
2266712_3	We scrubbed my friends dog in tomato juice after a run in with a skunk.  It helped a little, but it didn't completely get rid of it and you could still smell it a week or so later.  Maybe if you repeat it a few times it'll work better.

1789927_1	I am not quite sure I know what you are asking exactly, but I am assuming that you mean what could cause braces to not be affectiven and help teeth.  if someone misses an appt with the orthodontist, and dont get their rubberbands or use them, or dont get the wires switched out (each time you go and they switch the wire, it's a different gauge of thickness and it causes the teeth to get pulled closer and closer together everytime.  If they dont go do that, the braces wont work, and after the braces are off, if the person doesnt wear their retainer at all, the braces were a waste completely because the retainer coaxes their them together every night.
1172582_10	its probably the cold weather.  try sleeping with a humidifier.  my nose has been bleeding too, but usually in the morning not at night.
488870_3	Call the jail & ask.  You'll need a first & last name & date of birth & arrest date (sometimes).  They will give you the inmates booking number.  Write it down, because this is the way that an inmate is identified.  Ask about court appearence dates & they should tell you when the inmate is scheduled to go into court & which court they will be going to.  That booking number is mandatory if you want to sent mail or money.
3482928_8	Most junkyards will give you about $100 for a car. Just look them up in the phone book, call them and they will come and tow it away for you. You must have the title.
3467532_2	You can't spot-reduce, meaning you cant lose fat just from one part of your body. Your best bet is a healthy diet and lots of cardio and hope that the fat melts away from your thighs. Lunges are a GREAT workout for butt and thighs. They will be toned in no time. I also suggest you get a personal trainer, they are great help. Good luck!
3262502_0	It's a physichal means of expressing yourself about sorrow. Like cutting yourself when your sad, DO NOT ATTEMPT/DO.
2318465_1	My personal choice is to cut off excess fat before I cook the meat.
864801_2	You can put any fish on the grill really.  Just keep an eye on it.  Clean your grill grate so that it's shining (not black with carbon) and then put a layer of olive oil on it.  put some on both sides of the fish so that is won't stick.  It shouldn't take to long a hot grill and I recommend grill with the skin on (and up to begin) this helps it keep the shape, the skin will peel off with ease after its done.Squirt of half a lemon and some paprika and your set.
1287667_1	Tea tree oil, but then again.. if your not skeered to try a redneck band-aide.. i hear wrapping it in duct tape at night, something in the glue, makes them go away too. Maybe do a google search for uses for duct tape.  If it is a seed wart, ya can get it removed at the doctor, or if ya have a steady hand, and some liquor on hand, with a razor blade, can cut the see out, but practicing medicine drunk isn't a great idea.... Good luck.. mine hasn't came back and I used the latter method.
1287667_3	tea tree oil on the wart will help get rid of it, and also, olive oil will help . massage them in

1169611_1	Hello! People VOTED for these smoking bans. It was on the ballot in Florida a few years ago and people voted to ban smoking in certain places. This is why people have to vote. If you have a problem with the way things are than do something about it! In Florida, as far as bars go, it's up to the owner. If they don't want people to smoke, they can prohibit it. If the majority of the sales is food, you can't smoke at all in that establishment. Personally, I don't want to smell smoke when I'm eating either.

3236761_2	The only thing that unifies the Muslim groups is political hatred towards American culture. Without the USA the Muslims would kill each other. 70% of the university graduates within Saudi Arabia are male theologians that can't find a job and from that base OBL found a pool of followers.

3960285_11	Most people that use drugs are trying to fill a void.In our modern culture it can be traced to weak parents.Parents who are too busy to raise their children and really love them.To teach them right from wrong.Chidren interpret limits placed on them as love,if their parents let them do as they wish,children interpret this as uncaring,so children keep pushing to find a limit where they can feel safe.So many parents give kids material things as a substitute,when all their kids need is love.
4198452_0	It depends upon the law in the state where the policy was issued.  For example, my state gives 6 months to request a refund if the claim was paid by mistake; 18 months if the insurer finds out another insurer is primary; and an unlimited amount of time with NO limitations if the claim was either fraudulent or miscoded.. . Call your state's insurance commissioner's office for guidance.. . I hope this helps.

2761472_0	You can't make your wrists larger...your wrist consists of two bones, very minimal fat padding, and flexor and extensor tendons for your hand and fingers. You can do all the hand grip/wrist curl exercises in the world, but your wrists aren't gong to get any larger...your forearms will, but not your wrist.. . Incase you don't believe me...there is a formula used to calculate total body fat that, among other values, measures waist circumference and then subtracts wrist circumference. The idea behind this is that your wrist will represent the BONES in your body and not the muscle or fat.
1487774_1	Well you have 2 choices with this phone and i recommend using a card reader  it will be faster than using the data cable believe me. Also if your phone came with the data cable and drivers for the phone use bitpim is a free program and as 11/16/2006 they just came out with a new ver of the program with support for the LG vx8500(Chocolate).. Is a very easy program to use i just got my girlfriend a chocolate this past Wednesday and i was just playing with it today and i did a lot of transfers of tones and wallpapers and bitpim was awesome and easy to use.. But for music and such use the card reader instead.. Also bitpim comes with  an audio converter that will convert your tones to the correct ones before uploading to the phone.. Go below to get the program.
1515803_6	The cause, reason and the problem is due to the difference.... Human beings have self awareness..... Animals do not have self awareness..... Therefore animals depend merely on instincts of survival, whereas human beings, out of self-awareness have the choice to do as they wish with their life !
234348_2	Because we are still animals, and it's a survival instinct, such as fight or flee. This one is procreation.
85711_3	You are a student--right?So your main aim of life should be studies.Am I right?So if you think other things then its your fault and you cant realise it as may be you are facing a bad time.--so be careful Otherwise the students who really concentrate on studies and make themselves successful--they feel better after finishing their studies  and then they think what they should not now.Understand my point.Thinking other things will be for ever with you but once you finished your student life you cant make the career.Better make yourself very sure that what u want.Then either the career or the other thing.Later never blame others.

4179454_2	Hmm maybe because Hydrogen is the only known element that has no neutron? -_-. . It consists of only a proton and electron.. . The isotopes of Hydrogen are not exactly hydrogen. Deuterium, for example, is not Hydrogen but an isotope of it. So technically it is the only element with no neutron although its isotope is.. . As to why Hydrogen is the more important than its isotopes.. let's just keep our life simple =X

1016733_0	Elementary Chemistry and Physics are the basis for all technological innovations! . . What is technology? Applied Science.. . To apply that science, you need science first. Physics and Chemistry largely forms that "science". It is on this foundation that the whole of engineering stands.. . At first sight you may not be able to see the foundation because engineering has progressed so much! But when it took the first ever step, it was all cos of science!

Putting it the other way around, if you have muscle but stop exercising, you'll loose the muscle and put on fat. Look at those football commentators, for example

1153019_0	The planet Mercury was named after a roman "god", he was the messenger of the gods. He's the one with wings on his feet and a helmet with wings. The element mercury was named after this planet. Mercury was known for speed and mobility, which is probably why the planet (which is the fastest around the sun) and the element (which has mobility compared to other elements) are named after him.

4044842_3	No it doesn't mean you are pregnant, but you can get a pregnancy test just to make sure.  They can detect pregancy pretty early.  Periods can change due to stress so you may just be really stressed out about becoming pregnant.
4044842_5	You are probably just a little late.  Take a pregnancy test to check, but it probably won't show anything this early.  You will have to wait a few days to know if you are pregnant by rechecking with the pregnancy test again.

2231667_0	In bound call center is taking calls and outbound call center is making calls.  Customer service is probably the most stressful job out there.  I'm working right now and I'll tell you, I take an average of 90 calls a day from life insurance policy holders complaining about their policy.  The definition of customer service is helping the customer out as much as possible and answering any questions they have using all of your resources, common sense and honesty.
2231667_1	Customer service is when someone actually answers you question correctly and really does something for you.
2231667_2	customer service sole purpose is to address questions and complaints, mainly complaints, that customers have with the business's product or service. inbound call centers are the hub of customer serviec as they are the frontline in receiving and addressing customer concerns and complaints while also trying to solve them. the outbound portion of customer service is generally resigned for those problems that the customer service reps were unable to fix or attend to and need the advice of someone more qualified to address it. Usualy things like tech support or consulative solutions are used for outbound facilities.
470470_7	Because the only way to remove a sitting president is for him to resign (highly unlikey), or for him to be impeached.  Impeachment requires congress to find him guilty of an offense (like leaking a CIA operative's identity, going to war on false pretenses...)  And then voting to remove him from office.  And the Republican's have controlled congress for his whole term.  This fall, elect Democratic Senators and Congressmen - then there will be more accountability and Bush's actions will be far more limited.  . . Thought I doubt he'll leave office until 2008. . Remember, if Bush were removed.  Cheney would become president.

2803492_1	Generally, Insurance classify into a few categories.. . 1. General Insurance policies – to provide payments in the event of losses from a particular event usually asset; including car, houses etc.  . . 2a. Life Insurance policies – to offer income to oneself or family members in the event of death or total & permanent disability and in some case upon contract of critical illness, example; cancer, kidney failure etc.. . 2b. Life Insurance w/ Investment policies – depending on the owner objectives and needs, this type of policies includes investment elements that the insurance companies seek in assisting insured fulfilling their goals & objectives by means of investment..   . 3. Health policies – to provide payment for medical expenses.  . . As the word insurance, all the above seeks to offer monetary compensation in the event loses occurs.  It is one of the methods to transfer unwanted risk to the third party by contracts with an insurance company.
2803492_8	Look at insurance like this:  Insurance transfers the RISK (risk of getting in a auto accident, risk of dying, risk of your house burning down) from you to the insurance company.. . If something bad happens, and you have insurance, then the insurance company pays, no you!!. . as a Life Agent, this is the simpliest way to explain what Insurance is, and why it is important to have it.
2803492_9	you will  need insurance for various reasons. you will need health insurance to cover any sickness or health issue.  hospital and doctor visits can be very expensive. the insurance will help you financially. if you have a car, you must have auto insurance for the same reasons . it will also cover unisured motorists.
2803492_12	if your speaking of auto insurance its to protect other people on the road in case you cause an accident that damages their property or injures someone so that they are assured you can take care of the expenses created by your at fault accident.
2803492_14	What kind of insurance?  Auto?  Auto....one because it it probably required.  If it isn't, it's smart to have.  If you were in an accident and it was your fault, the liability protection would be beneficial.  Otherwise, the person who was injured is coming after everything you own. If you don't own much, they'll have it taken right out of your pay check.

3409803_0	Check your heads, rocker arms, and all your seals in the upper part of your engine, sound like something is off track or knocked loose and is causing uncombusted gas to fly out of the chamber and through you air intake valves. Also make sure your timing is correct, if not it could be causeing the piston to rise and or fall destroy the proper vacuum effect and will then cause gas to pump out your air intake vavles and pump it all they way back out to your carbeurator. If this is the cause, you should also have noticed a decrease in performance, anywhere from slight to emmense, and th car will hesitate quite often, especailly if the timing is off, because it is unable to burn the gas properly, and can even flood the chambers, and cause your car to die while driving!

3817936_0	Organic chemistry is the study of hydrocarbons - things that contain Carbon combined with other elements as well.. . Inorganic chemistry basically is the study of the properties and behavior of compounds that aren't hydrocarbons.. . Physical chemistry - According to renowned chemist Gilbert Lewis "Physical chemistry is anything interesting." As a combined science of physics, chemistry, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and quantum mechanics it functions to provide molecular-level interpretations of observed macroscopic phenomena. Typically, changes in temperature, pressure, volume, heat, and work of systems in the solid, liquid, and or gas phase are correlated to microscopic atomic and molecular interactions.. . The type of relationships that physical chemistry tries to resolve include:. . The effects of intermolecular forces on the physical properties of materials (plasticity, tensile strength, surface tension in liquids) . The effects of molecular kinetics on the rate of a reaction . How the identity of ions affects electrical conductivity of materials . Most cite Willard Gibbs as the founder of physical chemistry as stemming from his 1876 paper: “On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances”, wherein such cornerstones as free energy, chemical potential, and phase rule were developed.. . Modern physical chemistry is firmly grounded upon physics. Important areas of study include thermochemistry (chemical thermodynamics), chemical kinetics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, electrochemistry, surface and solid state chemistry, and spectroscopy. Physical chemistry is also fundamental to modern materials science.. . --- I havent had any physical chemistry yet. It sounds kinda scary lol. Hope this helped!

2794937_1	Vitamin E capsules are known to help fade scars, not just on the face, but any scars on your body as well. To apply, open a Vitamin E capsule with a clean needle, squeeze out liquid and smooth on affected areas. . . If your skin is on the dry side, you also might benefit from using rosehip oil, available in health food shops. Rosehip oil (or products containing rosehip) also assists in scar healing. But if you're still very acne prone and oily, you are probably better off with vitamin E.
849221_0	Maybe we are nearing the end of the age ,or the begining of the end.. It will only get worse from now on,and then the end will come.
849221_1	Because they BELIEVE so much and have so much FAITH that they can not accept what history has proven.. . They are so caught up in a book that they have read that they are oblivious to what really happens on this planet.
849221_2	You're right..."history repeats itself" and...Christ WILL return! Why not try reading and STUDYING the Bible?
849221_3	Yep everyone is totally my way is the right way and you'll like it or DIE!   Makes me sick..... . There are way too many religions in this world to pick one and go with it.  Everyone claims that if you don't believe in religion you're going to be reincarnated or go to hell or whatever.... Well, personally, since there is no clear way of choosing which is the correct religion and if I pick wrong I'm doomed anyways, I'd rather pick None of the above and not side with any of those close minded groups that seem to think they know better than everyone else.
849221_4	Sure history will repeat itself. Jesus one day will walk the Earth once again. This whole believer/non-believer issue will be sorted out once and for all.
849221_5	You assume a lot for someone who's never been in a church.. . "I know there is about to be another dark age if people are not careful. I can tell." ... Really, how can YOU tell, are you some sort of prophet of God?  Do you have a PhD in theology?  Let's see some credentials please!. . "people are just too closed minded and stubborn to see it or care" ... what people are you referring to?  Are you intimate with these people, did you do a study or a poll?. . "theyd rather focus on an old religion thats caused nothing but harm to everyone in and around it." ... Again, how do you know that this is what "they" are doing?  Did you do a study and ask a sampling of the religious population what their focus is on?. . Your generalize and assume based on no actual fact, and expect us to believe you?  Your question is moot, as you cannot even provide one fact or shred of evidence to support yourself, other than whats in your own lonely mind.. . So the answer is ... people don't realize it  because it's not happening, you are delusional.
849221_6	I agree there's going to be another dark age & it's going to be a lot worser that we've ever seen before. Man does not know the way to peace everytime our leader open their mouths & start talking about peace there's a war. Although  I still believe in Jesus as my Lord & Savior some of what you say is true. We've had WWI & WWII since that time more wars have been fought.
849221_7	People who have faith in their religion think there is no wrong in their religion.  They don't see how it can repeat itself although it does anyway.
849221_8	That's a pretty broad brush you're painting with, Kero. It's really unfair and incorrect to suggest that all of the monotheistic faiths have "caused nothing but harm to everyone in and around it.". . A small example: You probably could kiss modern science goodbye as you know it, if it wasn't for the Christians who believed God had placed intrinsic order in the universe that they could discover. Many of the major scientists 200-300 years ago that started the ball rolling believed in God.. . And many of the men who founded the United States were also firm believers. Some were more "deistic" (God exists but is detached from humanity and not entirely personal) in nature, but these are only two major contributions of believers in the faith(s) you're putting down. . . That being said, religion has been abused for centuries, as long as man has had it. Any belief system can be abused, especially one that believes that some things are right and other things are wrong. (And the only systems that can't cause damage are those that have no absolute values to exploit -- so they don't do much anyway.). . And there's a lot of garbage going on in our culture right now, regarding religious people who use religion as a means to  control others rather than serve them. So that's frustrating for everyone. . . But I think that's more a problem with the people, than with the belief system(s).
849221_9	I think FIGHTING for RELIGION is like "Balling for Virginity".. . Nuff' Said.
849221_10	Actually we are probably already in the dark age as far as religion is concerned.  Don't you find it amazing that some people come on here and condemn you and claim that they know you have never been in a church, but then want to know how you can claim something because you don't know the people your talking about.  And then they want credentials and facts, but if you give it to them then they continue to say "how do you know, how do you know they are right".  There is no sense in trying to have an intellectual debate with them because they are totally illogical.
849221_11	Just like fat people who can't stop buying another snickers bar.  It feels to good, not to pay attention to reality.. People have needs that aren't fulfilled through supernatural teachings thus they need more super-naturalism etc.  Its all about them, the larger picture comes last if ever.
849221_12	Kero darling, History isn't the only thing that repeats itself.  You sound like a broken record.  I really like your new picture.
849221_13	You mean like you and all your "questions" regarding religion.  You repeat and repeat the same stuff.  Most people aren't closed minded and stubborn ...I think they are just tired of hearing the same old stuff from you.
849221_14	Im sad still that the hate is continuing to build up inside you.  I wish that there was something I could do for you! I really do!!  I'm sure you were a really nice person at one time.  I wonder if there is still a chance to make a change and just move on with your life and start to enjoy it instead of wasting so much time wondering why people act like they do... Oh I know! You could go to college for behavioral therapy and learn to help others and unknowingly help yourself as well.

3143610_1	im gonna tell you something you wont believe.. When i was in high school i suddenly developed about 20 warts on each of my hands - dont ask me how or why. I went to the doctor to get them frozen - obviously he couldnt do them all in one session - it hurt like hell. Any way they came back, the freezing didnt work properly. eventually i got sick of it and tried something that id read somewhere. . . For 1 week 3 times a day i took salt in warm water and scrubbed my hands for 10 minutes each time with it. After that week half of them (the smaller ones) were gone, within 2 weeks every single wart that i had was gone and they have never been back since - it is now over 10 years down the line.. . Anyway i dont know if you try it if it will help (depends on the kind of wart), i hope that it does becuz it was the simplest, least painful most inexpensive way to get rid of them.
3143610_2	There's an easier way to deal with warts than using celandine - cover them with duct tape.  It may sound weird, but one of the chemicals in duct tape's adhesive helps remove warts.
1000150_3	Some people, not necessarily just black people, take an offense to them as being racist. As long as you didn't intend your rude behavior to be based on race, then you have nothing to worry about. If they think you were being racist, then that is their problem not yours.

946189_6	When you use a calling card you have to dial an access number first (well most of the calling cards I know work that way), so if you call your friend by using a calling card it won´t show her your phone number because it is like if you were calling from a different phone number. I don´t know if this might work, but you can give it a try, you can tell your friend to store into her cell phone the access number you usually use to place the phone calls as if that was your phone number, MAYBE (not sure), next time you call her by using a calling card your name will show up.

3015355_5	This is a wrong perception .. Tamils are not hostile to North indians .. There is along history behind it . The srilankan war , the language conflict etc .. North Indians Discriminated Tamilians on the basis of colour .Tamilians and north Indians have this language clash there .. Tamilians are called by names as Madrasi etc which is very wrong ..

3186063_2	lower the temp of your oil, it's too hot.  cover the pan while the chicken is cooking too, that helps keep the moisture in the chicken.  also, don't use huge pieces, they'll take longer to cook, use a smaller bird.
3186063_12	When I fry chicken without a coating, I put the chicken in the frying pan and cover it with a lid.  I cook it covered for about 20 minutes.  This basically steams the chicken and then I take off the lid and the chicken will brown and leave those tasty bits at the bottom of the pan.. . If I use a coating like dry pancake mix or flour, I fry it with a bit of oil until it has browned and then put it in a roaster with the lid, for about 40 minutes in the oven. (you can use the same frying pan if you want but you have to drain the oil first ).  Take the lid off for the last 10 minutes to crisp it up.  The chicken will be tender and moist.
3611744_5	Imagine being a creature,a predator,living eons ago.You spend several hours stalkinga prey animal,and you're just about to pounce when the pry spots you and runs.You give chase and are closing in,when the prey jumps into a thicket.Where did he go?You pace back and forth and then just wait.RRRRRip...the prey farts,you pounce,and voila!Dinner is served!That's funny.

One religion would say hey we have the answer to get closer to God come and join our church, and for century's people went on believing that they have the answer on how to get closer to God, and none of them work. If people wanted to get closer to God. Just learn the words that Christ taught us. but people for get that, and relies on their church. Even Martin Luther said "Salvation can survive outside the church, but not outside Christ."

1752934_6	What you're thinking of is just a "house-flipper". It's a part of real estate investing, but not the only part.  A lot of investors also rent out their property. For example, my uncle is an investor, all of his money comes from renting. He owns lots of buildings, strip malls, etc. He has a huge apartment building with 100+ apartments, each paying him $1000 a month, thats a lot of money. He also owns commercial real estate, which is when you rent out space for businesses. . . So basically there's two areas of real estate investing, leasing  and selling.. . Hope that helped

1509982_2	Well chemistry can be a basic Science because really...you use it everyday especially if you cook.  Thats all cooking really is chemicals and experiments.  Baking brownies for example all chemistry...gather your materials gather your ingredents and combine to form something new and next you put into oven and the chemical reaction takes place because of the convection of the oven the heat cooks the batter and your end result brownies ta dow! . . Definition of Chemistry: Branch of science concerned with the study or the structure and composition of the different kinds of matter, the changes that may undergo, and the phenomena that occur in the course of these changes. .

A good rule of thumb is 1 pound a week, thats 4 to 5 pounds a month give or take.  You see you want your weight to be Lean muscle not fat. Trust me I know, when I was 21 I was about 100 lbs also.  I became friends with health freak and I put on 25 to 30 pounds in about 1 year which is unheard of.  SO up your calories that you eat a day, but make sure its good foods not junk.

3560813_1	It was about terrorism!!!  Saddam was housing terrorists and promoting them for years!  He has made numerous threats to America and ruined his own country(not to mention the possibility that he may have had WMAs which some people here say they just found them)!  The most common mistake liberals make is that they try to convince people that Saddam and Osama were in this thing together.  THEY WEREN'T!!!  Afghanistan was to take out al Queida and Iraq was to protect us from further attacks from others who do the same kind of tihng...TERRORISM!!!!  If it wasn't for people like you, we may have been outta there by now.
3560813_11	The Iraq war was planned by Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz during the Clinton Administration. In fact they tried to get Clinton to invade. It was, and is, and will be about the oil. If you want to look at the success rate of our GWOT, just take a look at Afghanistan. The Taliban is now running 1/3 of the country almost with impunity. And the Afghan peoples are welcoming them back. We didn't finish a damn thing we set out to do in Afghanistan and now it's coming back on us. Look at Somalia. Islamic Extremists are threatening to overthrow the government there. . . This is a new type of war. A war that can't be fought by guns and bombs and invasions. This is a war about peoples well being. Why have the Taliban made such strong strides in Afghanistan? Because they're bringing stability to the region. They bring the rule of law. . . If you look at the statistics for the places where extremism is on the rise, you can see that those places are very insular and have high rates of unemployment. These people have nothing better to do and have families to support. A lot of it isn't about idealogy. It's simple economics. And THAT is where we need to fight this war.. . And for those of you that say it was us liberals that tied Saddam and Al Qaeda together, please go back on listen to what YOUR president said. It was the Administration that implied that they were linked.

4430566_2	Maybe here on earth absolute zero temperature  (-274c) is'nt posible to achieve just yet; but I'm sure that in the fardest region of space, were no visible light source or infrared light or any form of heat is within millions of light year distance, absolute zero must be present and anything within this dead freeze would be motionless, all the way down to atoms and quarks.
4430566_4	To reach absolute zero, there has to be an object of lower temperature, which could "steal" the heat from the cooled object. So, spontaneous reaching of absolute zero is not possible.. . If using a kind of refrigeration, there also has to be a  material that has lower temperature than the cooled one, to get the heat from it.. . Thermodynamically speaking, the second law says that entropy can't go down witout some work applied. To achieve absolute zero, an enormous work would have to be applied, but in working conditions that could disable it (around 0K all motions stop or are extremely slow). On the other hand, every work produces some losses of energy, that are transformed into heat. So, while lowering the temperature, the device would produce some heat, and thus "denying" it's own function by rising the temperature.

1850068_12	You know, the most abundant element in the universe is hydrogen. Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen. Inside a star, hydrogen is transformed into another element called helium. It undergoes a process called combustion. Turning hydrogen to helium releases tremendous amount of energy that powers a star for billions of years. Combustion releases heat and light. That is why stars gives off not only light but also heat as a form of energy.

2582920_0	None.  The Prune industry sucessfully lobbied the US congress a couple of years ago to get the official term for a dehydrated Plum changed from Prune to Dried Plum. as Prune had a bad connotation for a lot of people
2582920_1	A dried plum is a prune.  A dried prune is redundant.
2582920_2	A dried prune is a raisen.and a plum is not dried sorry tell you.   That....they are nice a jucie.
2582920_3	A dried plum is a prune just like a dried grape is a raisin,  but a dried apricot is just a dried apricot...I think.  LoL.
2582920_4	The difference is spelling - . . P-R-U-N-E     . . P-L-U-M. . a prune is a dried plum.  However, prunes have connotations of "old, consitpated guys". . It's simply a marketing ploy.

2582920_10	a prune is a dried plum
2582920_11	a prune is  a dried plum
2582920_12	Same. . A prune is a dried dark(not red) plum
2582920_13	No difference they are the same, both are delicious. love them, are good for you, too. Will keep you running. LOL
2582920_14	They are different fruits entirely.  Similar but different.  Prunes taste nasty.
2582920_15	Basically the same thing, can be used interchangeable:. . A plum is a stone fruit tree in the genus Prunus, subgenus Prunus. The subgenus is distinguished from other subgenera (peaches, cherries, bird cherries, etc) in the shoots having a terminal bud and the side buds solitary (not clustered), the flowers being grouped 1-5 together on short stems, and the fruit having a groove running down one side, and a smooth stone.. . Any of more than 125 varieties of fruit, most grown for drying. Four of the most common varities are French, Imperial, Italian, and Green Gage. Prunes are cultivars of plum species (mostly Prunus domestica). In general, prunes are freestone cultivars (the stone is easy to remove), whereas plums are cling (the stone is more difficult to remove). Dried fruit of the prune tree were traditionally called "dried prunes" or "prunes", but an effort is currently underway to market them as "dried plums". Fresh prunes reach the market earlier than fresh plums and are usually smaller in size. Prune juice is more fiber-rich than plum juice and is often marketed as a way to increase regularity.
2582920_16	Nothing. The people who produce and market prunes (growers & grocers) changed the name to "dried plum" to make the product more appealing-sounding. People have somewhat negative connotations with prunes (old people, prune juice and it's "effects", etc.). . So it's really the same thing. Just with a little spin.  ;)
2582920_17	exact same thing
2582920_18	A dried plum is a prune, a dried prune is dust.
2582920_19	I guess it is the same as calling a raisin a dried grape.
2582920_20	Dried Plum is an advertising term.  It was used to get young people to try them, because of the association of prunes and prune juice with the retired.  It is the same reason that there are white and red pistachios.  Try to find a red pistachio growing.  You never will because they are dyed red to be more appealing to the consumer.
2582920_21	A dried prune?. . That's like saying wet water.  Prunes are already dried.. . A prune is a dried plum, that's all.
2582920_22	Its the prononciation. . PLUM.. P; L UHM. . PRUNE.. PRRR UUH NNNNN
2582920_23	A dried plum is a prune so I don't quite know what I dried prune is?
2582920_24	Try looking for something else in the store
2582920_25	Until recently a dried plum and a dried prune were all called the same thing, prunes. . . Prunes are actually a cultivar of plums. In general a cultivar is a plant the has been specifically cultivated for certain properties and actually has recieved a different name.. . Prunes and Plums differ in certain desirable areas. The two terms use to be interchangeable, prunes could have ment either dried plums or dried prunes, even though are technically different friuts. The reason why there is a confusion, is that dried plum makers don't like the negative feeling towards the name prunes. So they have started marketing thier products as dried plums in order to move away from it.

821387_0	Get a cat or use mouse traps. Poison is the cruelest as they have a slow and painful death from dehydration.
821387_1	Home Depo sells live traps.  You just put so peanut butter in it.  When a mouse walks in, the door closes.  Then you just release the mouse outside.
821387_2	try sticky traps. thats how i got rid of mine. if you check the traps regularly you can free them from the traps before they're injured by pouring vegetable oil over the trap. it takes a steady hand & a strong stomach, but i think it's easier to stomach than killing them.
821387_3	If you are seriously looking for a humane way to rid your house of mice, the only option is live traps. These catch the mice inside a box-like structure so you can release them elsewhere, preferably somewhere far from any houses. People usually have mixed results with these. You could also just get regular spring mouse traps. They usually kill the animal instantly, by breaking their spinal cord. Just be sure to check them often.. You also need to understand how the other methods work in order to pick the right one. Rat poison doesn't cause dehydration, but instead it causes internal bleeding, until the animal eventually dies. MAKE SURE TO KEEP THIS AWAY FROM PETS OR LIVESTOCK-- THEY WILL AFFECT THEM THE SAME WAY. and treatment is expensive.  Glue traps work by trapping the animal and waiting for them to starve to death or dehydrate. Can also be harmful for pets. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me.
821387_4	i have field mice in my house at the moment we live near trees. i get the spring mouse traps these work try and find out where to they are coming in and but these traps there they like jam, cheese and chocolate but i eat all the chocolate . it does work. those box traps dont work
821387_5	close up all entrances  in your foundation so you are not right on  the mouse interstate. Close all the mouse diners -IE store ALL food in containors/cans metal prefered, sweep up the crumbs if you can.. Cats really are  a deterent . Heck if you found your hometown  without grocery stores, easy commuting & godzilla moved in wouldn't you move out.....
821387_6	Breakneck mouse and rat traps are more humane than poison. Poison is a slow death, and the sick mice get eaten by owls and other predators. The poison enters the food chain and carries on killing.. Buy traps, bait them with chocolate or gravy on a piece of bread and leave them against the walls and skirting.. If you use the live box traps you have to release the mice about a mile from your house or they come back. Mice can also freeze or starve to death in them so check them every morning.
821387_7	Politely ask them to leave your home and never come back again!!!!!!!!! This is the most humanely way!!
821387_8	invite my cat over,she is a great mouser! Try Decon:) IT works,i have used it before and.....bye bye mice pluse my cat helped:)
821387_9	There is no humane way to kill mice, think about it regardless of what you do you are likely to cause them pain, and as they cannot tell you how they feel how are you to know........ the gentler you are the more likely they are to return......Just buy a mouse trap and do it the same as evryone else.
821387_10	my sister in law is soooooooooooo against animal cruelty she preaches constantly about animal cruelty she doesnt eat meat or wear leather or suede she boycotts all animal teted products so when her home was over run by mice she got 8 live traps went on holiday and came back to 7 starved to death mice!  now if i was a mouse and had the choice id rather a quick snap of the neck than starving to death in a box no  bigger than myself, if you choose the live boxes remember to check yhem regularly and if you do catch a mouse make sure you take it at least 3 miles from your home before letting it go or it will find its way back to you!
821387_11	thats not humane! drown them. They say its like your at peace before you even die. That was how we got rid of one of our rats. Had to do it the viscious git.

821387_13	sit them all down and explain that you are evicting them and that there is a nice field not so far away..I'm sure they will understand ..OR    call in a firm who will rid these vermin for you (local Council) if you dont they will breed every seven days and leave dropping everywhere they are deased ridden things which can seriously affect your home and they chew electric cables causing fires ..so stuff being human just clear them immediately
821387_14	You could get a non-venomous snake or two and let them hunt the mice. That could be fun. Let nature do it's thing.
821387_15	yes they do eat it.or search for the pied piper of Hamelin!
821387_16	Glue traps and then set them free.
821387_17	Be polite...ask them to leave!!!
821387_18	call the pied piper?!. . The rat poison I used worked for the mice.  They ate it, but went elsewhere to expire.
821387_19	Thats gay, just kill the bastards. Maybe if you ask them nicely they'll go away.  Call an exterminator.
821387_20	get a cat--it's nature's way.
821387_21	burn your house
821387_22	not sure how many you have but we live on a farm and they find their way in sometimes. What works well for us is . . #1 we have a cat who is a great mouser! . #2 we put glue traps around where we know they frequent, so we catch them without poison. . #3 we stuff up their entries with steel wool & seal over it with plywood or spray foam insulations. . . We have gone 1 full year now without any noticable signs of mice. . . We choose not to use decon (poisons) bacause we dont want them smelling up the place. But, if you decide to use it, they will carry it back and feed it to their little family but be prepared for at least a week or two of very smelly living. ;o). . Goodluck, I know its annoying!
821387_23	You can get the council or environmental health department in, or  you can use humane traps from a hardware/diy store or you can do what Hugh Fernley-Whittingstall in that river cottage programme did . He got a couple of white witches in. They lit candles and  and asked the mice to leave....and it worked !!!
821387_24	yes they eat the poison

2585846_1	There are a lot of products that can be bought at Petsmart that can get rid of the smell. Febreeze can also help if you use a lot of it after you wash offending area with a 10:1 dilution of bleach. To get rid of the cats you may have to ask your nearest Humane Society for some humane traps to catch these strays even if they  do or don't have an owner. If they belong to a neighbor then they need to keep their pets indoors and have them spayed (for females) or neutered ( for males). Good Luck to you.
2691737_4	because their called GANGS> theres no such gag that runs alone. I think the guys in  compton can answer that better, tho. ask them.
2570358_2	Old wives tale for getting rid of warts is to sell them and it REALLY WORKS. Ask someone to buy one from you for 10p and before they give you the money get them to touch the wart with the coin. Within a week the wart will be gone  TRUE. Good luck

3526253_5	Depending on what it is, you can add a bit of yellow mustard in it. It will not take on the mustard flavor, and the spices will calm down a bit. Can actually enhance the flavors of whatever you are cooking, especially in Bar-b-que sauce!
1830835_1	What type of Indian???
3186995_3	Yep, there definitely should be. I've been looking through some of these questions and I was thinking,what if a kid read this? Some people say that a separate adults and kids one would be hard because the kids would only go on the adults one, but surely if you have a log in/out then there could be some sort of age restriction. i don't know! But I do agree that there needs to be two separate sites
696850_3	well, if that is the most important thing to you, you could try to kill someone famous - it worked for hinckley.  its probably not only the easiest, but also the most sure-fire way to become famous.
3133147_9	Because they can. thus the entire point of freedom of speech
3133147_11	This is the result of marxists attempting to destroy our freedoms by turning them in on themselves and deconstructing them.. . Freedom of speech becomes freedom of criminal speech (intimidation, violence defamation etc.)  The point is that, when it becomes unworkable, ALL freedom of speech is eliminated.
1077370_0	All primates have skin whirls on digits. But with monkeys the prints are most easily identified on the feet.
1077370_1	Don't apes have finger prints too?
1077370_2	all primates have finger prints
1077370_3	In humans they are called finger prints,as in other species they may be called paw prints,or as a lot of other prints, tire prints, foot prints, snake prints etc. I think the reason for prints are for identification from whatever source that has them, and too it doesn't  hurt to think of prints as shields? Think, how would your smooth fingers fare in the real world?
1077370_4	I thought kitties and doggies have paw prints. Don't those count. Ne-ways I guess only animals with fingers can have fingerprints, Are u sure monkeys don't?
1077370_5	dogs have something like finger prints except they have nose prints...no two dogs noses have the same nose
1077370_6	Because other animals (notice how I refer to us as animals, because we are!) have paw prints or claw prints or scale prints! Lol, its just what they decided to call them, that's why!
1077370_7	Same reason we don't have tails like some animals do - we're all different and special in our own ways that set us apart from other life forms.
1077370_8	Untrue.  All primates also have fingerprints (almost identical to humans!). So do koalas.
1077370_9	monkeys have fingerprints too
1077370_10	Fingerprints, footprints, faces, speech and mannerisms are all unique to each person.  Animals have their own unique traits (the stripes of a zebra or the spots on a cheetah) We can identify any human, animal, bird or fish. Fingerprints happen to be a human trait, that's it!

3295055_2	Could be a fungal infection (don't panic!!)  or vitiligo (whitening of the skin due to lack of pigmentation)... But it's best to get it checked out by a doctor or dermatologist.
3295055_3	The sun!
3295055_4	Sounds like a fungal infection.  There is cream for that but phone your doctor or even your local pharmacist for the correct one.  Make sure it's not catching since it's on his fingers......if you know what i mean lol

2519825_4	A writer is someone who talks with paper and pencil.
2519825_11	I am not a writer nor a poet, but sometimes I observe something that has meaning or touches me in some way, and words begin to flow in my head.  If I have pen and paper with me at that moment, I write it down.  If I don't, well I guess it's lost, because my short term memory is not good.  I  therefore carry a pen and notebook in my purse at all times.  It's almost like creating a painting but using words instead of colour.  How great the finished product is really depends on how much it inspires the reader or the observer.  I usually just keep my scribbles to inspire my lover...Lol.

229566_0	I work in Customer Service for an animal supply company on the west coast. I have a set customer base that I service. It is so much fun to work with the same customers. I get to know them, their stores, their ordering patterns, etc. They begin to trust you and depend on you to help them through issues they have with their stores. Most of the stores we service are small Mom and Pop corner shops, so this is their bread and butter.  I love the person to person contact and the fact that I get to build a relationship with my set customers. I don't think that I would be nearly as fulfilled in a customer service department just answering any old line.... Hope that helped!
229566_4	Some people are just made to work in customer service. It all depends on what field you're going into. I didn't mind working customer service at a bank because it was quiet and there was always something to be done. I HATED working "customer service" as a telemarketer, though....for obvious reasons.

1993777_2	Well the kamikaze pilot worked to take out military and the suicide bomber of today wants to murder innocent people. Don't confuse and insult those pilots who died in Kamikaze attacks with the cowardly acts of nut job suicide bombers of today.
1993777_10	the kamikaze was a member of the Japanese Air Force he got a pay check. the suicide bomber could be anyone. the kamikaze pilot wore a uniform the suicide bomber could be anyone. The kamikaze went after military targets. The suicide bomber will go after anyone of any thing. The kamikaze pilot got a shot of Saki and a clean head band. The kamikaze pilot were going after air craft carries for the most part and i don't think most middle eastern people know how to swim.

800545_5	The key to getting a six pack is losing the body fat. You cannot simply spot-lose--as in, losing fat JUST on your stomach. Fat loss comes with overall body loss--so if you are chubby to begin with, you lose arm fat and lower leg fat before you lose fat on your waist, hips, and thighs. If you are skinnier to begin with, you lose fat on your torso--stomach, waist--since the other fat is already gone. The key to getting a six pack, thus, is to do lots of cardio (given you already have plenty of muscle.) Stripping the fat away, you will reveal your abs. Also--eating right is just as important, if not important, than simply hitting the gym. Building a killer body is about 30% gym and 70% nutrition.
978119_1	pressure difference betweem top and bottom of straw.  . . Sum forces, acting down to push water out of straw = weight of water plus (pressure acting on top of water column * area of column {straw}).  . . Force acting up to keep water from running out of straw = pressure acting upward (atmosphere) * area of straw.. . Set force up = force down, you get that the column of water will descend until the weight of the water left in the straw = area of straw * (upward pressure {atm} - downward pressure {partial vacuum on top of column because it moved down a little}).

1794143_6	Perhaps because to answer a question right you have to put thought into your answer. It seems like a lot of people just want to be smart a**es or don't really want to help others. So keep the brilliant question coming.

696168_3	Maybe it's easier to blame FEMA spending than to investigate the Insurance companies knowing that they would not get anywhere with the insurance companies.. Why try to do something beneficial when they can sweep it all under the rug, know what I mean?. Congress always takes the easiest way out of everything.. Actually both should be fully investigated.

3614208_5	I think you should buy or make her a hutch so that she's more secure. Alternately, you should bring her inside and make her an indoors bunny. If she's free in the garden constantly, she's also not very safe - because she's at risk of being attacked by predators like birds of prey, owls, cats, foxes. Also, if you keep your bunn indoors with you, she'll really become attached to you. Anyway, have a read of these sites' recommendations for cage sizes and security -. http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/rabbits/a/rabbithomes.htm. http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/rabbits/a/rabbitcageidea.htm. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/housing.html. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/outdoors.html. http://www.rabbit.org/journal/4-4/pen-living.html. http://www.rabbit.org/journal/1/cage-manufacturers.html. http://www.rabbit.org/care/living-with-a-house-rabbit.html. http://au.geocities.com/leaswebsite/bunnyhouserabbits.html - my site - have a read and hope it's very helpful!
3052195_10	Don't you find it amazing that even being round like a ball we can stand alike in the north or south poles, without falling in the atmosphere, this is what Allah is giving you example to understand, if you are trying to say that Allah has no knowledge of the earth being round then know that He mentionned that even the sun orbits before the scientist discovered it.

2132924_12	As you already know, we are all unique. Aside from the dna and genes inside from our parents and ancestors, every life lived is different. Our experiences vary, our perception of those experiences vary. Through our experiences we form new perceptions and views of the world. Every person we encounter, every event we've experienced, every thought in our head creates who we are. Our own 'uniqueness' is developed over a life time, depending on you belief system it is also developed through the lives we have each previously led. Some believe that we carry inside our spirit wisdom and lessons from past lives that assist us in our present lifetime. Kind of like Bill Murray in the movie Groundhogs Day, how he kept reliving the day over and over until he got it right, we continue to live lives, learn lessons, gather the wisdom and allow it to perfect who we are to become.

2885982_2	by just letting the tanks "run" for a week or so isnt really doing anything-you need the fish and the waste in the tank to grown the bacteria bed you need or by some thing from the pet store to "grow" bacteria. However, and I dont care who disagrees-I did this for all my customers in my store and it never failed me---when you want to buy fish, ask the dealer to give you a couple of bags of the "water"  in the tank and siphon some of the dirt from the gravel--this is the already grown bacteria and will give you a head start providing the tank isn't infected at the time.   I have set up fresh water and salt water tanks from 10 gal to 125 gal and seldom lost a fish. Like I said, most people wont agree but it never failed me and I always save some in my tank if I ever decide to strip it down but all I do is once in a whihle, remove 3/4 of the water and fill her up again after I vacuum the gravel.
3340360_6	OK i dont really get ur question but  yes the christians dont really understand islam  because they might have never herd of it, and i dont think nearly any christians know who phophet muhammad is because they dont even know abt the religion!. . thats why people who are muslims should explain to the others!!
2605412_2	the answer would be for arabs who call themsleves "palestinians" and all the other arabs/muslims to stop attacking israel and leave it in peace. Example, israel left gaza, thus  it was no longer "occupied" so what did the muslims in gaza do??? they STILL CONTINUED to attack israel!!! over 500 rockets launched. Islam MUST end its war against israel

Some people may say...just don't eat it but that is a silly answer!. If you end up having to eat the chocolate or crisps then go for the healthiest one there is.

The Iraqi people are subject to their laws (and law enforcement) and soldiers are subject to military law (and law enforcement).  That some Iraqi people violate their own laws is no reason for American soldiers to act in a criminal manner.

2625849_1	Depends on whether you're cooking lamb chops or a roast.  For lamb chops, I love them rubbed with garlic and rosemary, then cooked over high heat on the grill, but not too much - medium rare is just fine.  For a leg of lamb, slow roasting in the oven is best.  You should use a meat thermometer to make sure the temperature reaches about 160 degrees in the thickest part - about 20 minutes a pound at 325 should do it.

3665231_23	german could not deal with cold weather.
3665231_24	I believe that the German invasion of Russia failed because the Germans failed to learn from history. The French, also, failed to invade Russia. Russia is a very large place. It has very harsh winters. The Russians will allow an army to go deep inside it's territory, then cut off the supply lines. Through a scorch earth policy, they destroy all food and shelter. Then they let mother winter do her damage. The invading army simply freezes and starves.
3665231_27	I believe it failed because Hitler did not learn history before becoming leader of Germany.  If he would have learned some history he would have never even gone to Russia.  Napolean Bonaparte tryed the same thing Hitler did and also failed.  Those who dont learn history are doomed to repeat it.

4147302_5	If you truly love this cat and he has been altered, the only thing you can do is keep him indoors only! Not only is he terrorizing your neighborhood, he's at risk of getting run over, shot, poisoned or in a fight with a cat that does get the best of him, and possibly injure him very badly and also possibly transmitting diseases like Feline Leukemia and FIV. Make sure you get lots of toys and play with him often so he doesn't miss the outdoor as much, and a window perch is a nice thing to have for him to sit it and watch the outdoors while remaining safely inside.
3777714_0	What type of ounce and pounds?. . In troy weight, for instance, a pound is 12 ounces, so 30 troy ounces is 2.5 troy pounds
3777714_1	1 lb= 16 oz, so two pounds is 32 oz, therefore 30/32=1.0666lbs.

The culture is such that everyone is ok with bio engeneered tomatos, picked green in Florida, put in a closed truck pumped with metane gas so by the time the truck arrives to New York the tomatos are red.. . the bottom line is that breast milk is not plastick and as such it is foriegn to american mothers.. .

205928_13	I have two words for you: Opus Dei. I have more to say: catholicism has a nasty history. and if catholicism is corrupt then so is the rest of christianity. so it makes it so much easier to watch protestants shoot themselves in the foot when they bash catholics, another sect of christianity.
3479795_2	(from Ferdinand Petiot) . The most commonly accepted theory is that the Bloody Mary was born at Harry's American Bar in Paris in the 1920s, spurred by the arrival of the first tins of tomato juice from the United States, according to Dale DeGroff in "The Craft of the Cocktail" (Clarkson Potter, $35, 230 pages). Vodka was relatively new in Paris at the time, thanks to Russian emigres fleeing the Bolshevik revolution, and bartenders were mixing it with just about anything. . . The man credited with the drink's invention is Harry's bartender Ferdinand Petiot. When Petiot crossed the Atlantic in the 1930s to run the King Cole Bar in the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, he made a few changes to his creation. He used gin, according to DeGroff, because vodka was not yet available in the United States. And he renamed the drink the Red Snapper because the term "Bloody Mary" wasn't deemed acceptable at the time. When the drink flipped back to vodka, it resumed its original name. . . That name may have blue-blooded roots (the English Tudor queen) or a more blue-collar origin (a Harry's regular named Mary). Another theory appeared in The Chronicle's 1975 obituary for Petiot: An American entertainer who sampled the cocktail at Harry's said it reminded him of a Chicago club called the Bucket of Blood. . . Over time, the basic recipe has evolved to include vodka, tomato juice, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, lime or lemon juice, celery salt and black pepper, with Tabasco sauce optional. Just as coffee can run the gamut from black to caramel-mocha-frappa-whappa, the Bloody Mary is prone to variation. These include the Bloody Caesar (made with clam juice), Bloody Maria (tequila), Bloody Bull (beef bouillon), and others made with beer and sake.
3479795_3	Bloody Mary Cocktail Timeline. . 1926: Fernand Petiot, an American bartender at Harry's New York Bar in Paris mixes equal parts tomato juice and vodka. Petiot says: "One of the boys suggested we call the drink 'Bloody Mary' because it reminded him of the Bucket of Blood Club in Chicago, and a girl there named Mary.". . 1927: This is the year that George Jessel claims to have invented the Bloody Mary in his Palm Beach home. He claims the name happened when his friend Mary spilled some of the concoction on her shirt and she said, "Now, you can call me Bloody Mary, George!". . 1934: Petiot moves to the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis in New York. His drink becomes popular with New Yorkers but something is missing. The hotel asks him to change the name to the Red Snapper, but it doesn't catch on and it is again called the Bloody Mary. His patrons encourage him to make the drink spicy, so he adds cayenne pepper, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, and a big dash of Tabasco® sauce. The recipe is a hit.. . March 30, 1956: George Jessel takes out an ad in Collier's that reads: “I think I invented The Bloody Mary, Red Snapper, Tomato Pickup or Morning Glory. It happened on a Night before a Day and I felt I should take some good, nourishing tomato juice, but what I really wanted was some of your good Smirnoff Vodka. So I mixed them together, the juice for body and the vodka for spirit, and if I wasn't the first ever, I was the happiest ever.”. . Aug. 15, 1956: The Bloody Mary is mentioned in Punch magazine: "Those two ... are eating raw steaks and drinking Bloody Marys.”. . July 18, 1964: Petiot tells the New Yorker: "I initiated the Bloody Mary of today. George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms.". . Jan. 8, 1975: Petiot dies in San Francisco.. . 1976: The McIlhenny Company introduces Tabasco® Bloody Mary Mix.
3479795_6	The name may be attributed to Mary Tudor, the daughter of Henry VIII. In her brief five-year tenure as Queen, she managed to kill off most of her Protestant adversaries and became affectionately known as "Bloody Mary" to her nearest and dearest. Another account tells of a patron who said the drink reminded him of a girl named Mary he knew at the Bucket of Blood Club in Chicago.
3887243_13	It is idiotic to take the words of the bible literally.  Much the same as it would be to read the stories of ancient greek and roman mythology and say they are a hirtorical record.  Suffice it to say, the bible is christian mythology, parables intended to teach lessons, nothing more.

2062189_0	History is not boring.... It makes sense of the world.  It puts into context how and why everything in this world is so messed up.  I often hear that people study history so we don't repeat the mistakes of the past, but that is untrue... we always repeat the mistakes of the past.  I think we study history to learn how to conquer people and mess things up like people in the past have done.  Learn and follow by example.. . If you are still in high school or lower level grades then you're right... history is boring because they are giving you a watered down version which is often flat out lies. . .  Wait til you get to college... you will learn stuff that will blow your mind... then again, if they lied to us all the way up to high school, maybe they lie to us in college too??? just a thought...
2062189_2	have you ever heard the saying history repeats itself or learn from other peoples mistakes. if we don't learn history how can we possibly handle the future.

3604708_3	Religious freedom is a misnomer.  Most of the settlements were started so that other religions would not be present to interfere with their own.  They were not usually actively oppressed in Europe, they were simply intolerant of others who did not believe the same way.  Proof:  When they started their American colonies, they were very intolerant of outside beliefs within their colonies (not a characteristic of one who believes in Religious freedom).

One need only listen to pop music to see the level of crap that the people accept as good.

3741453_16	He became the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. He hung for 3 days on a cross so that we would have the possibility of being saved. We are naturally born into sin. Note: you don't have to teach a kid to lie, you have to teach a kid NOT to lie. It is our nature to sin as lying is a sin. So, He came down, made Himself a man and was crucified so that we might live. He rose again on the 3rd day to show us that He would come again for us. There is a reason to live a true, Holy repentant life as He is alive and He will come back for His people. Those that do not choose to believe this way will be punished the Bible says by living in eternal damnation, Hell. Those that choose life and believe will be saved. How to be saved? Acts 2:38 clearly gives a path:. 1. Repent- tell God you are sorry for your sins. 2. Be baptized in JESUS name- not the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost it must be in HIS name. 3. Receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  This is evidence that you have received Jesus Christ into your heart as you will speak with other tongues as the spirit gives utterance. . This is the best gift, LIFE, in the world!
537603_10	The perception of what is beautiful is purely subjective. While there are things which are universally accepted as beautiful, their appeal to the individual as beautiful varies from person to person. For example, a Madagascar hissing beetle may be revolting to one person, but a thing of incredible beauty to another.  But while it is pretty much an accepted standard that there is no ugliness in anything natural the appeal of certain things in nature will vary from person to person.
838135_7	I'm not an American citizen (thanks God) but I guess answer of your question is; money. Your words sound like a racists words but I hope you're not.. . I think bosses of the world living in USA have just 'exhausted' a market which is owned by "whites". Whites are bored with their-selves. And popular culture is forcing people to "ask for more". For more entertainment, for more pleasure, for more bull**it, popular culture producers can use ANY-thing. And blacks are "different" for you "white Americans".... . Well, in fact I don't have any problem with black people as I don't have any problem with any kind of color. I'm a Muslim and I just protest "popular culture" and its dynamics. Here is my point.
838135_16	Every kind of (I guess what you are describing) would be called a "trend" has been copied from something else. Not just black people. Latin Music for example... (unless Latino's are black... in that case I must be color blind. Another example would be Country music... hullo?. . There exists a unique connection between art and civil society in our American democracy. We are a nation of nations, deeply dependent upon the ability of our citizens to communicate across lines denoting difference -- difference in religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, language.. . Since the late nineteenth century, American music has evolved as an expression of the social climate and environment of the times. Throughout its modern history, this expression has diverged into various styles attracting its disciples of music taste. Some expressions, like traditional jazz, Dixieland, big band swing, disco, and others stagnated, refusing to evolve, becoming footnotes and addendums of this rich history. Today, the adherents of this music reveal its beauties with anachronistic fervor. Some expressions, like jazz, the Blues, Latin, and others, continue to evolve into refined stages and altered states. Its music re-emerging with each generation in creative and unique combinations. But nowhere, to this point, has the message been more important than the medium that sends it. To this end, rap music has emerged with a style more concerned with the content of its message than the constructs of its art form. . . You shouldn't make such an non-educated statement.

956682_10	Hi! Here is  the ultimate weight loss program that  makes you look good, feel good and raise your energy and self esteem by losing  up to 30 pounds in a month.. check the link below for full details.
956682_14	Cut off your legs.. . 30 pounds in two weeks is too much of a shock to the system. At the best, you can hope to lose eight or so during that time.. . Anything more can cause the yo-yo syndrome and make it even harder to lose weight.
956682_15	Maybe 15, but I doubt you'll lose 30 in only 14 days.  I do know that if you buy some Colon Clense, that you can get rid of your old "crap" that is stuck in your system.  That's at least 10 pounds!  Instead of diets, try changing your eating habits to foods that cleanse your system, rather than foods that hang around & are hard to digest.

4275012_1	first of all the dogs that the public and media report as being pitbulls arent ! there usally crossed out with some other kind of dog thats a kerr or should i say a chicken ! the types of dog that bite people do so out of fear and pure bred pitbulls arent scared of anything! most importantly if every one is suggesting that pitbull fighters train there dogs to bite people , that wouldnt make any sense ! i mean isnt there people in the ring when these dogs are fighting ? once again if any dog bites some one and does alot of damage then its automatically a pitbull and i dont think thats fair to the breed . especially the purebred pitbull .
4275012_13	pit bulls aren't dangerous.  irresponsible, uncaring pit owners are dangerous
587487_6	Great! Another cry-baby bed wetter bemoaning natural behavior. Look,....people are racist due to an in-borne sense called "survival instinct". Every creature on the planet has it. Only certain humans are devoid of enough active brain cells to allow themselves to be propagandized into believing in equality and tolerance. Racism is normal, natural, and being an unabashed racist  means that your mental "wiring" is functioning properly.
1911392_1	She can have it removed by a doctor, use a wart remover (Freeze Off), try keeping a banana on it until it comes off, or keep a penny on it until it comes off (like you would with the banana).  Just keep covered tightly.  My mom had a wart when she was a child and just left it alone and it went away.  Just try different things until one works or she might just want to live with her wart.. . I suggest trying the banana first.  Just cut a slice of banana and place it on the wart.  Then secure it with something sticky (a band-aid or tape).  Keep replacing the banana with a fresh slice until it goes away.  My sister tried it and it worked (on two different warts) and they never came back.  The band-aid might look crazy on her face but if the wart goes away you will accomplish your goal.

1257519_4	We make hick ups due to an improper swallow or food stuck in our esophagus triggers a nerve spasm in the esophagus near where it meets the stomach. . . Some people develop hiccups for psychological reasons. For eg. in a reaction similar to the paralysis some soldiers suffer when they're afraid of combat, these people subconsciously give themselves hiccups as a way to avoid something disagreeable.. . To cure hiccups you can distract the person's attention from the affliction or making him or her gasp. That's usually all it takes.

4006446_0	Yes I would switch.  If the new teacher does not work out, you can switch again.
3559048_0	You can't. If you dont have the title, u have to be a 'landlord' and claim the car has been abandoned, then u can file for the title. Unless, u find someone who knows nothing about cars.
3559048_1	You have to find someone that buys junk cars with or without titles
3559048_2	you can have a lost title search done throught the registry and then sell the car. Costs about 50 bucks for the service. If it is truly a junk vehicle that you want to get rid of many junk yards will buy it from you without too many questions asked as they in turn sell them in loads to large recyclers who also don't care where it came from cause to them it can be worth anywhere from 100 to150 bucks per Net ton (2000 Lbs). So a 4000 Lb scrap car is worth 200 - 300 bucks to the junk yard guy so he'll pay you about 40 bucks for it then sell off the parts. Good racket eh?
3559048_3	File for a lost title.
3559048_4	call the junk yard
3559048_5	as a parts only car. or you can apply for a 'lost title' to get one, or a 'salvage title'
3559048_6	I think you can sell a junk car to a junk yard with out a title, since they'll be scrapping it for parts. And If they do happen to get the clunker road worthy again, then the junk yard can apply for a salvage title so they can sell the car again.. . Other than that, I don't know of any other way. Best to call your counties clerks office and find out if there's any other way available to you.
3559048_7	Need to apply for a salvage title. You can try your local Division of Motor Vehicle for assisstance.
3559048_8	try http://www.craigslist.org/ ....(pick your city)... it rocks
3559048_9	if you own the car legally you can sell it as is with no title just a bill of sale ( in NC anyway), or you can go to the DMV and file for a new title but that will cost you money.. if it's junk it's not worth the cash and the wait time
3559048_10	If you have the VIN (vehicle identification number), you can order a replacement title.. . If the car is truly a junk car and won't ever be on the highway ever again, you can sell it by a private bill of sale.  Just draw up a piece of paper with the buyer and seller's name on it, describe the vehicle as best you can, include the purchase price, and both of your sign it.
3559048_11	You do not have to have a title for a vehicle in order to sell it. The byer or the seller for that matter can apply for a new title from the state from which the car was bought. For example, I just sold a 94' Mitsubishi Eclipse with out a title. I bought the car in North Carolina. I call the office of finance there an apply/request a new title. It takes a few weeks. No big deal.

3280768_3	You have the question, backwards!! Don't you mean, why do the muslims, hate the United States? Did we ever do anything to your people? Besides give millions of dollars, every year? You think we flew the jets, into the twin towers? I don't think so..What does your second statement, supposed to mean? I am a Christian, but I be damn if I get attacked by non-muslims? You think everyone is a muslim? Why do you muslims, have to bring up religion, in whatever you are talking about?
3280768_9	I don't think that is true.  I don't hate any religion.  And I don't think the majority of the American people do either.. The majoriy of the Muslims I have met are sweet gentle people.  You have to blame the Islamic terrorist for the hatred  you are feeling.  Most Americans don't understand Islam.  Sone think that Islam is responsible for these terror attacks.  It's just ignorance.  I hope that you don't think that all Christians are bad.  I don't think you really do.  We are all human beings.  Some are more closed minded than others.  This is part of life.
3280768_18	Then I guess you Muslims shouldn't be attacking non-Muslims. Islam is a religion of intolerance and anger. Don't believe me check out 9-11 or look at France and all those burning cars , give me a break, or better yet look at all those Muslims the Muslims are killing- Vicious. Its kinda like saying "the world misunderstood poor Hitler" don't think so bud, People just don't tolerate evil  maybe that's why.
4031851_6	dont call Jesus an idiot. . . Jhn 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
4031851_10	In order to be born again, you must ask JESUS into your heart and repent of your sins.  It's as simple as that.. . Most born again believers are genuinely concerned about you having to go through the tribulation & your immortal soul being cast into hell on judgement day, when the LAMB's Book of Life is opened.  They want you to go to heaven and the truth is sometimes harsh.. . Please accept the Lord JESUS into your heart, be born again and avoid the agony of hell.. . GOD Bless you!
676028_0	Because Americans have been complacent, and too trusting of elected officials for so long that they have concstructed the laws is such a way that it benefits them more than us (the non-elected citizens).. It is too late to do anything about certain laws they have already passed, but we need to become more watchful of our elected officials.
676028_1	They all take great care to make themselves rich before they leave office.  That way they do not need SS like the rest of us.  Haven't you ever noticed that every politician has more money when they leave office then they had when they came in?   Hmmmmmm...What's wrong with this picture?
676028_2	Because they keep like you away from poeple like me.. . Did you just call them Federal Senators?
676028_3	I don't know. And I totally agree with everything you said. It is sickening!
676028_4	I agree completely. The reason we feel so unsure of our future benefits is because they don't have to worry about them. I am all for term limits, campaign contributions disclosure, and across the board benefit elimination.

2300405_11	Why is this road so important to America? . . The Beginning. . Although entrepreneurs Cyrus Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and John Woodruff of Springfield, Missouri deserve most of the credit for promoting the idea of an interregional link between Chicago and Los Angeles, their lobbying efforts were not realized until their dreams merged with the national program of highway and road development.. . While legislation for public highways first appeared in 1916, with revisions in 1921, it was not until Congress enacted an even more comprehensive version of the act in 1925 that the government executed its plan for national highway construction.. . Officially, the numerical designation 66 was assigned to the Chicago-to-Los Angeles route in the summer of 1926. With that designation came its acknowledgment as one of the nation's principal east-west arteries.. . From the outset, public road planners intended U.S. 66 to connect the main streets of rural and urban communities along its course for the most practical of reasons: most small towns had no prior access to a major national thoroughfare.. . http://www.national66.com/66hstry.html
2300405_17	it goes thru all the small towns and back roads of America. It used to be the only way across the USA before the interstates. Look at a book called "Blue Highways" by William Least Heat Moon. Great story about America's back roads.
421753_0	Lure it out with food. However make sure the skuks tail stays down or..... Well lets just say it will really stink when it's up.
421753_1	we live in the country so these Lil' critters like to make their themselves  known on occasion. They only spray when they get scared so if you run into one face to face just back away slowly and they will go the other. Don't get excited and less you want sprayed. To keep them away from areas you don't want them sprinkle black pepper in that area about once per week and again after a good rain storm, they hate the smell and will back away quickly, soon they will remember that area has that smell and not bother to come around. Keep all outside pet food picked up for the are looking for food. keep trash picked up and get rid of it daily if possible or keep in tightly sealed cans. And NEVER EVER let your dog chase them off unless you want to be washing it up the next few days. Good Luck

421753_4	we just had a family of 6 skunk babies picked up by our local animal "rescue" group.  The mom was nowhere to be found.   You might check in your local phone book for a wild life rescue group. They had nested under a home that was the site of a large community festival.
421753_5	Once i got the product 'Shake Away', I've never had another problem with these critters..and it's not cruel or painful to them...instead it contains the scent of the skunks most feared enemy which is the fox. It's inbred in skunks to natually fear the fox and when they smell the 'Shake-Away' that's sprinkled on the ground --- they flee and never come back.
421753_6	actually, this was the tip I got from animal control, which is very odd, but they swear by it....urinate on your property line..... . sounds wacky, but it keeps them away.
421753_7	Google the National Trappers Association, or your states trappers association, find a nuisance trapper near you and he or she will be able to get rid of the skunk for you without it spraying. A reliable nuisance trapper will have a spray-no pay policy. The best product to get rid of the smell is called Skunk Off. . Remember that just because you are calling a trapper doesn't mean the animal will be destroyed or hurt. The trapper will use a live-trap and may release the skunk far enough away from you that it will not become a problem again.. Forget the lemon or tomato juice.... and good luck!
421753_8	shoot it in the back
421753_9	contact animal control-they will set a trap
421753_10	Call the police or the aspa.
421753_11	i dont suppose you have an anti aircraft gun just lying around the house, do you?  they work great.  if not, dig a small hole and put a mouse trap in there (the ones that snap shut).  cover it with grass and put whatever skunks eat on top.  also great fun with birds :)
421753_12	easy. eat it and hang its skin on your door so it will be an example. of what you will do to any other skunk that waddles over to your house
421753_13	catch it's smell and throw it in it's face.
421753_14	Leave it in the backyard or whatever, then call animal shelter?
421753_15	RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
421753_16	call some knid of animal shelter. they will probably get someone to get it away.
421753_17	shoot it
421753_18	got a 22?
421753_19	i just saw someone on here that wants one for a pet call him

2901201_0	Not just an american dish..the apple pie...was first known overseas,..in europe...apples through the popularly by people such as ben franklin...john chapman who became known as johnny appleseed...caused the apple to become well known in the new world later to be called colonial america...and finally the US o A.  Because it is so deep in our american culture from the early days,apples, and pies made with them,"as American as apple pie" was coined and the term has been used for anything pertaining to things we americans like....usually things that have been around a long time..
2901201_3	Apple growing and apple pie originated in colonial America. When our states became independent from England the phrase As American as apple pie originated.

There is magnetic north which your compass will point to, There is the North Pole the earth rotates on and then there is North which would be the top of the earth as compare to the sun and its orbital plane. We can also refer to north based on the position of the galaxy and assigning one end as North and the other as south. North and south poles are used in navigation after the discovery of the compass needle always pointing north.

3381250_9	most black people are racists because they feel like theyre still being oppressed by the whole slavery thing. they feel like just because of slavery they can say racists remarks about other people as if they can judge them. its kinda like getting back at other races. oh yea im half black...and im not racist....some black people are though
3381250_22	I am not Black and know many black people who are good people.  It is kids like you that come from narrow minded families that think differently of people of different color.  Any kind of person can be rascist whatever their colour.
3381250_23	Personally, I think this is a very good question!. . Example:. Why do all Whites get punished by, say teachers for being racist, why do they get into trouble when they swear at Black people?. . But why does the majority of Blacks get away with racism against Whites? I've been to a few school where Black people are hardly, or mostly never punished!. . Why is this?

Liberals have in the past denounced Saddam, N Korea, etc - but today - they are incapable of claiming anything is evil, for it would agree with Bush, Reps and cons alike. . . They look at public perceptino, then make a decision after they have poured over that perception. Immediately after 9/11 - every Dem Senator and liberal made grandiose soap box statements  concerning "evil" - because the American public required it. Now, that the sentiments are largely against Iraq - they have switched gears and denounce anything "evil"

1853599_7	Those 9-11 widows, and I do feel sorry for them, were a carefully selected panel of democrats  to bash George Bush and blame him for 9-11. The so called 9-11 commission was a Democratic party ploy to attack bush. It is pitiful that anyone lost relatives on 9-11. But their political views just happen to coincide with the democratic party line because the democrats and news media made sure that only democratic 9-11 relatives were selected to speak.  I pitty their loss. But the 9-11 relatives are simply political instruments of democrats and leftists and at this point their views should be ignored.
2740284_5	Try melatonin.. . You may find Melatonin in health food stores, pharmacies, and some supermarkets. It comes in a number of forms and a wide variety of dosages, so make sure to examine the labels carefully and select a product that contains the proper dosage for dogs. Make sure that it does NOT contain other herbs or nutrients. The usual dosage is 3 mg for a dog that weighs over 30 pounds. In a few cases, very large dogs weighing well over 100 pounds needed 6 mg, but that's unusual. For dogs that weigh less than 30 pounds, give 1.5 mg. For a tiny dog, reduce the dosage even further. Keep in mind that 1,000 micrograms (mcg) is equal to 1 milligram (mg), so a 200 mcg pill, which is a common dosage form, contains only 1/15 of the amount recommended for a large dog.

2479423_0	Well seriously...blind people use the bank too.  Maybe someone drives them there to use it or maybe they walk.  What are they supposed to do just sit at home and do nothing.
2479423_1	It is actually cheaper for the manufacturer to make all ATMs with braille than to make different kinds.  It's all about saving a dollar.
2479423_2	ATM machines are mass produced.  The hardware on every model is identical.  As a result, brail pads are applied to every machine since the factory doesn't know if it will end up in a drive thru or bolted onto a wall.  The enclosure, not the machine is the only thing different about drive thru and bolted units.
2479423_3	HAAHA
2479423_4	I would say for the blind.  Obviously they did not drive by themselves.  Banks provide it because if another person has driven them to the ATM,  the blind may want to use the keypads themselves for security reasons so they would not have to depend on the one who can see with their password and/or banking purposes.
2479423_5	Drive-up ATM buttons are marked with braille because federal regulations require it.. . Section 4.34.4 of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (Appendix to Part 1191, 36 CFR Chapter XI, issued pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990) says, "Instructions and all information for use [of an automated teller machine] shall be made accessible to and independently usable by persons with vision impairments.". . Drive-up ATMs, unlike the walk-up variety, don't need to be wheelchair accessible, but the rules make no exception regarding accessibility by the blind.
2479423_6	I have asked this question before and also heard this question a lot, no one has given me an answer. I think we should ask the people who design the atm machines. I wonder if they just make them all the same, so they just have them on them, because the ones in malls do too..????
2479423_7	because the manufacturers of the keypads only make one style, so it's cheaper that way, instead of making a separate one just for drive-thrus.. . By the way, damn near any question that begins with "Why...?", the answer is MONEY.

2783398_1	The nucleus serves as the cell’s command center, sending directions to the cell to grow, mature, divide, or die. It also houses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the cell’s hereditary material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope, which protects the DNA and separates the nucleus from the rest of the cell. The nucleus contains most of the cell’s genetic material.. . The nucleus is a dark structure located in the middle of the cell. It controls the cell's activities, and acts like the cell's brain. Inside the nucleus there is DNA which contains genetic information. The cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance inside the cell where most of the cell's activities take place. It's made out of water and other chemicals. All cell parts, except the nucleus, are located in the cytoplasm.. . Kinds of nucleus : . . Bose-Einstein nucleus (2 kinds, 11 facts) - Nucleus of even A-number (i.e., those with integral spin) (cf. Fermi-Dirac nuclei). Bose-Einstein nuclei do not obey the exclusion principle, and their ground state has zero angular momentum. . . deuteron (6 facts) (d) - The nucleus of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. It consists of one proton and one neutron bound together., The nucleus of a deuterium atom. md = 2.01355 amu..  . even-odd nucleus (3 facts) - Nucleus that contain even numbers of protons but odd numbers of neutrons. . . Fermi-Dirac nuclei (2 facts) - Nuclei of odd A-number (i.e., nuclei that do not have integral spin) (cf. Bose-Einstein nuclei). Fermi-Dirac nuclei therefore obey the exclusion principle (q.v.). . . isomer (2 facts) - Nucleus with the same A and Z numbers but in different energy states. . . isotone (2 facts) - Nucleus with the same number of neutrons but with different A and Z numbers. . . isotope (3 facts) - An atomic nucleus having the same number of protons as a more commonly found atomic nucleus but a different number of neutrons. For example, the hydrogen nucleus has a single proton; deuterium has one proton and one neutron and would be called an isotope of hydrogen. (see neutron; proton.), Two nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are said to represent the same element, but different isotopes. For example, helium-3, with two protons and one neutron in each nucleus, and helium-4, with two protons and two neutrons, are two different isotopes of helium. . . nuclide (2 facts) - A species of atomic nucleus, analogous to the word "isotope" for a species of atom. The word is also used to distinguish between atomic nuclei that are in different energy states. . . proton (13 facts) (p) - A subatomic particle with positive electric charge. Every atom has at least one proton in its nucleus; the number of protons determines the element. For example, all atoms with one proton are hydrogen, all atoms with two protons are helium, and so on., One of the constituents of the atomic nucleus. It is a spin-1/2 particle carrying positive electric charge. The proton is the lightest baryon and, as a result, is the particle into which all other baryons eventually decay. It is believed to be absolutely stable, but certain theories (GUTs) predict it will decay very, very slowly., A baryon made of two up quarks and a down quark. It possesses a positive electromagnetic charge and can only be found in atomic nuclei. A single proton is a hydrogen nucleus., A massive particle with positive electrical charge found in the nuclei of atoms. Composed of two up quarks and one down quark.

It controls the activities of the cell by directing protein synthesis. The nucleus contains a smaller body called the nucleolus.
2783398_9	Nucleus: in physics, the extremely dense central core of an atom.. . Atomic nuclei are composed of two types of particles, protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons. A proton is simply the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom, the lightest atom, and has a unit positive charge. A neutron is an uncharged particle of about the same mass as the proton. The number of protons in a given nucleus is the atomic number of that nucleus and determines which chemical element the nucleus will constitute when surrounded by electrons.. . The total number of protons and neutrons together in a nucleus is the atomic mass number of the nucleus. Two nuclei may have the same atomic number but different mass numbers, thus constituting different forms, or isotopes, of the same element. The mass number of a given isotope is the nearest whole number to the atomic weight of that isotope and is approximately equal to the atomic weight (in the case of carbon-12, exactly equal).. . .

It is very rich and delicious, and is best served with rice pilaf and steamed garlic broccoli.. . 4 whole chicken breasts, halved. Salt & freshly ground black pepper. 5 tbsp. unsalted butter. 1/2 c. cognac. 3 tbsp. unbleached all-purpose flour. 2 tsp. dried tarragon. 3 1/2 c. non vintage champagne. 1/2 c. heavy or whipping cream. . Sprinkle the chicken breast with salt and pepper. Melt the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven over medium high heat. Brown the chicken breasts, a few at a time, on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.. . Pour cognac into the pan, warm it and flame with a match. When the flames subside, stir in the flour and tarragon. Cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk in 3 cups of champagne. Return the chicken to the pan. Cover and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove the chicken to a warmed serving platter. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup of champagne and the cream. Cook the sauce over high heat until reduced and slightly thickened. Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve immediately. Serves 6.. . EDIT-CIty Girl is full of bologna.  You don't need some fancy spice needle to have flavorful chicken.  Use vinegars, broth, or wines along with plenty of spices.  Try cutting your chicken into smaller pieces, particularly with breasts.  I usually fillet them because they are so incredibly thick.  The thinner they are, the quicker and better they absorb the flavor!!

In America we try to tell the world how they show live but our self are immoral and don't know which end is up are down.
4027949_1	Because they don' t want to accept it.  They don't want to see reality.
3061093_2	Um.  George Washington became the First President years after the Declaration of Independance was issued.  Not sure if you realize that GW did not sign the Dec. and wasn't one of the "founding fathers" - England had already lost the war - therefore, control of the colonies - before GW was made President.. . Why don't you read up on US history prior to making Osama out to be a hero.
24637_5	English is all about context. A lot of our language is riddled with double meanings, proper and un proper usage, while yet some people just use the wrong words to express themselves.
558570_0	You have the right to petition according to your first ammendment. If that fails, like you said, use your other rights. Speak out. Your words matter!
558570_1	Join the yahoo group pet-law.  There are many knowledgable people there and you can learn to help fight anti-dog legislation.. . Suggest and ENFORCE a leash law, that will actually work.. . To the poster who suggested contacting peta - LOL!!!  The 'animal rights' groups are not at all about helping animals, ESPECIALLY peta (who euths 85% of there 'rescues')!  It is about ending all domesticated animals and animal usage including meat/leather.  These groups are PUSHING anti-dog laws while feeding you the phony we love animals crap to get donations.  HSUS, Peta, DDAL, IDA, and many more or NOT animal welfare groups at all, but groups that want to stop you from having any animals at all.. . . BTW, more kids are killed by their PARENTS than PBs every year.  You have a greater chance of getting hit by lightening than killed by a dog.  Maybe parents should be outlawed..... . . Be careful with dangerous dog laws as well.  In my area, my dog would be considered dangerous if she chased a kid on a bike.  If my dog were to get loose and chase a bike (mine wouldn't but many dogs would) they can legally shoot her.  They can also legally shoot her if they *think* she *looks* dangerous.  And how do we know they are qualifyed to make that judgment?  They have to take a beginners obedience class with an already trained dog.  After teaching obedience for 25 years I know how little most people still know after an 8 week session.  I am obsessive about locking my gates for fear of what might happen should they ever get out.  At the very least my show/performance dogs would come back spayed, at most shot dead in the street.
558570_2	I really hate to say this, and I know how you feel, but there's not a lot of honest options against breed-specific legislation (BSL).  Assuming buckling under this outrageous ban is not an option, and all the Pit Bulls in your city are verified as such, then the outlook is bleak.  You know it's wrong, I know it's wrong, and the people who signed your petition know it's wrong.  . Where I used to live there was also a breed ban against Pit Bulls, but my dog was registered as a "boxer mix" by the Humane Society.  There's always the "Pit Bulls are not a pure breed" argument, but since Pit Bulls are a pure breed according to the UKC and anyone who owns a Pittie, that's out. . All I can say is, be stubborn like the dogs you are trying to protect.  Petition again, publicly protest, anything legal to tell your city that this is wrong.  Bug those who approved of the ban until they give in, and never give up hope.   God bless you and all the dogs in your city.. . Also, as gothicmidnight pointed out, people who fight dogs won't be slowed down by another law.
558570_3	WTF. Can they do that? I would write to your senator! This is an outrage and dog discrimination! PLEASE TELL ME HOW THIS TURNS OUT!
558570_4	Consult legal counsel.  You should be able to prove in court the correct number of valid signatures if you had them.  . . It's not going to reduce dog fighting.  They'll just use boxers or some other breed.  They should probably instead have instated a commissioned ASPCA task force to crack down on dogfighting.  . . If dogfights aren't a problem in your community, there is no reason to ban these animals because they train well, are excellent with children, make terriffic guard dogs, and are one of the more stable breeds mentally/emotionally.  If it's a community concern about attacks, they should ban Dalmations & Chow Chows.
558570_5	The CDC as come out against breed banning because it dose not work.  One pit bulls are rank forth from the bottom in attacking humans.  People who fight pits don't mind breaking another law to keep them.  The ASPCA study as shown that people who train for and fight dogs just go to other big breeds to use.  Give your city something else to do.  A dangerous dog law covers all dogs.  It punish the owners of dogs that act out in a dangerous way.  It also gives harsher punishments to people who let their dogs run loose or just dumps a dog because they don't want it any more.  These two action causes more attacks than any other.  People should be punished for their actions that leads to dog attacks.  There is another woman on this forum that as actively help people with your problem.  I think her email is alicebnnt@yahoo.com.  I know she will help she is passionate on this topic
558570_6	dont reverse decision, put them all down

558570_9	I have been helping other people out by gathering information and videos. Did you know thatI n World War I, a pit bull named Stubby captured the heart of the nation. Stubby was the unofficial mascot of the 102nd Infantry Division and was credited with saving the lives of several of his human comrades. For his valiant service, Stubby won several medals and was even awarded the rank of sergeant! He came home from the war to a hero's welcome and went on to become the mascot for Georgetown University.

558570_10	Not too much hope here for pit bulls winning. You best read the following legal battle in Denver and all the appeal results. . http://network.bestfriends.org/animallawcoalition/news/postdetail.aspx?gu=animallawcoalition&np=2455. . The problem lies will all those owners who raised dangerous dogs for fighting, and all those pit bull owners who did not realize just how dangerous, even a normally friendly pit bull can be without a strict regimen of obedience training that would prevent the dog from being a menace.. . I am not against pit bulls, I happen to like them. I am against owners who never train their dogs (all breeds) and people who fight their dogs, or raise them to be vicious in order to guard property (i.e., junk yard dog). . . It will take a lot of work to gain public confidence for this beautiful animal.. . P.S. for rvogelpohl2001 and danjelho. The pit bull is no more dangerous than any other dog in initiating an attack. They can however, cause more damage than most dogs once an attack begins. Actually, for initiating an attack, usually for no apparent reason, the toy breeds are the worst. This animal takes a special kind of person for an owner, a person willing to make sure the animal is well trained and socialized. This entire problem is not the fault of the dogs, but of the people and what they have done and not done with these dogs.. . The American Pit Bull Terrier is the breed most people think of as the pit bull. They are in fact, a wonderful dog. I lived with one and I know.. . "The American Pit Bull Terrier is a good-natured, amusing, extremely loyal and affectionate family pet, which is good with children and adults. Almost always obedient, it is always eager to please its master. It is an extremely courageous and intelligent guard dog that is very full of vitality. Highly protective of his owners and the owner's property, it will fight an enemy to the death. It is usually very friendly, but has an uncanny ability to know when it needs to protect and when everything is okay. The American Pit Bull Terrier can be willful and needs a firm hand. They are generally okay with other pets if they are raised with them from puppy hood.  For the most part they are very friendly, but not recommended for most people. Excellent with children in the family, they have a high pain tolerance and will happily put up with rough child play." http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitbull.htm
558570_11	With all due respect, Pit Bulls are very dangerous.  I know they say they are only as dangerous as their owner makes them but, that is not true.  It's in their instincts to attack.  That is why they are being banned.  . I wish you luck on keeping your pet, I feel for you.  Truly.. But, I would not get your hopes too high.. Did you make sure your signatures were verifiable?. That may have something to do with them being ignored.
558570_12	so, how many children do you want to see maimed or killed before a ban will be OK with you???
558570_13	There's a TOTAL BAN of new-born pit bulls in my area because of a few recent, gruesome attacks against humans. . . The best thing I can suggest is to motivate the public in your area to support AGAINST the ban, and bring it to the attention of your local politicians.

2713263_22	The world is constantly rotating, so time has to change.  The sun shines on different parts of the world at different times.  It used to be that all of the world was on the same time, but people kept getting confused, because noon was broad daylight in some places and pitch black in others.  It is confusing--especially since there are some places that don't observe daylight savings time--but it really does work out best for everyone across the globe.
4234902_0	Your neighbor may be feeding him later at night when you are asleep because if your neighbor was only feeding the dog once a week then the dog would more than likely be dead. He could have an automatic feeder that holds alot of dogfood. If the dog looks like it is skinny, and and starving call the local animal control for neglect of feeding his dog. This is called lack of responsibility to care for his dog, and that is animal neglect and abuse.

2551845_1	Please, don't gobble up all of the right wing hatred towards liberals.  I've been listening to Rush on and off this morning as well as Al Franken.  Rush claims that the left could care less about this event and Franken decries the whole episode as ludicrous (the episode being the right trying to convince the world that the left is terrorist-loving).  This is a proud moment for the American military.  They did a great deed by ridding us of this terrorist.  Don't generalize.
2551845_2	Because capturing the head of the terrorist organizations is the LEAST he could be doing, not a "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" event.  Bush even has the sense to qualify it as not having much effect on terrorist actions.. . Why do you Bush supporters keep your heads in the sand on how things are going in Iraq and only come out to cheer these little steps like they were the end of the war?
2551845_3	danno73 beat me. Everything he said expect the part about voting for Bush. I voted against him and him not-so-evil twin, Kerry.
2551845_4	... well, me personally... I want to find and kill the people responsible for 9-11... call me crazy... I haven't seen anything ever linking him in any way to 9-11... has anybody got anything linking him?.. please cite something.... . Zarqawi is responsible mainly for attacking troops in Iraq, from what I understand... which is bad, yes... but Zarqawi seems to be more a product of us going into Iraq than a reason why we are there...
2551845_5	I'm with you.  I have no idea.  I'd love to hear a liberal's explanation on that one.
2551845_6	The sad part of what you point out is the reality of politics.  The left, particularly the far left, can not give GW an ounce of credit or success in anything.  They have successfully beat and beat upon any negative items they can.  Look  how they blew up the prison scandal...certainly some American soldiers went to far and we're punished...but the crime was in politicising it to make GW and his party look bad and give comfort (and ammunition) to our enemies.  . . Isn't it ironic that much of what the DNC produces in terms of talking points match that of al queda today?
2551845_7	Because all liberals suck... they all act like they know what they're talking about but they have nothing to back it up with.
2551845_8	Because people in the media and on the left just hate him
2551845_9	Because he was just one of the "dead enders" who have been in their last throes  for over a year - just ask the real president, Cheney.  And it took someone to rat on him.  BUT, if it is a big deal, I haven't heard Bush say we're pulling out NOW.
2551845_10	BECAUSE SIMPLY PUT LIBERALS DO NOT WANT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT.  IT'S ALL SIMPLY A POLITICAL THING BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT ANY FAILURE OR SO CALLED FAILURE AS A VICTORY FOR THEM.
2551845_11	How is the lead story on every news broadcast and every news paper in America on THE LIBERAL MEDIA a non event???  Oh, if you were looking for a boost in the polls, ain't gonna happen.  A moron is a moron, it's just too bad it took 6 plus years for most Americans to figure that out. . . You asked the question though that brings up an interesting point.   Perhaps you should explain just why the mastermind of 9-11 is NOT in custody?  Don't say "Because he's hiding", because your idol, W, has said that already.  But he's also said, he's not a priority anymore.  I wonder what 3000 families think about that, but the "LIBERAL" media doesn't interview them too much.. . Oh, and by the way, didn't seem like W was all that inspired about the capture of the #2 guy.    Just FYI, #2 is not #1, got it?. . Another thing, . Isn't "Art" a LIBERAL thing?  Someone is a closet liberal.  You know what they say about being in the closet.
2551845_12	no,moron,it was a big deal.. all is fine and war is finished and all the world love americans. and terrorism is defeated.
2551845_13	As a moderate, who voted for Bush the answer is simple.  Killing Zarqawi is the perfect microcosm of the whole war in Iraq.  Heroic soldiers execute with pefection a plan to track down and eliminate Zarqawi.  Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . . It is wonderful that they got Zarqawi, unfortunately it will hardly put dent in the violence.  It might not even chip the paint.
2551845_14	They don't want to see progress, they just want to see us out.  Taking away their ability to wave something around just hurts them deeply.  Don't be too hard on them.
2551845_15	Because Bush's critics are liberals pussies who are never happy and who just wanna reap up his failures, despite anything good that happens.
1957235_1	Don't wait until they're teenagers to guide them.  Instill good values and morals in them.  The Bible says in Proverbs 22:6 to Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.

I seriously doubt that I would take my advice, let alone ask for it here.
2555569_3	One way to make the ear stop hurting is to have someone blow some smoke or warm air into your ear.  Another way is to soak a cotton ball in warm mineral oil and placing it in the ear.  If it doesn't go away you should go see a doctor because it could be infected.
3411123_0	A lot of Americans are not familiar with foreign credentials and therefore dismiss them.  This doesn't mean that your credentials are not worth less.  Just keep trying because someone will recognize the hard work you put into your higher education.
3411123_1	There has been news overseas of scandals regarding national exams and the educaional systems in other countries. Remember, what makes the news is generally an isolated case, but it has been generalized to sound like common practice. At the same time, there are many different educational systems and criteria that it is hard to make comparisons. For example, as a general rule, most US universities will not consider a candidate for a Master's program if the Bachelor's was completed in less than 4 years. Countries that follow the British educational style will have spent a period of "pre-university" that can take up to 2 years before taking the final exams for the chosen papers. Then, completion of a Bachelor's degree takes only 3 years. To compare with the American system, we have the general education subjects before specialization tends to occur. In effect, bith systems are doing the same thing, it's a hang up about the time factor or classification of an area with which most are not familiar.. . Another idea to help keep in mind, for professional types of degrees and qualifications, each country has specific ideas as to what should be in the curriculum. For example, medical schools also empasize patient care and communication as part and parcel. Other countries medical degrees take less time as they empasize more on pathology and diagnosis. . . One more thing to remember, in the US we don't have a national standard. The US universities are independent and may not even accept credits from another US university. Many universities DO offer bridging programs where should you not meet the tradtitional requirements for a master's degree, you can apply your experience as well as take a few subjects you lack to re-evaluate your situation. Thos means you won't have to repeat everything - just fill in the gaps in your education that do not meet the standards of a particular university.
3411123_2	One major reason is that there are around 200 countries in the world, many of which have different requirements.  Usually, there is a way to get recognition for your education without having to start from the beginning.  For example, physicians from other countries have to take a special exam to be licensed to practice medicine in the U.S.
3411123_3	The US has so many highly educated people here with degrees that are doing odd jobs.  Having a degree doesn't mean you have the necessary experience  required to perform the delegated chores associated with that profession.  EX. as a question.  Would you want a doctor with a degree but no experience operating on your back without an  experienced doctor assisting?  Of course not..    Another situation exists within this society, and that is the other side of the coin... There are so many people  with the same experience already in line for the same profession you are in, that  have the experience being looked for.   They already did their internship and the such (which are required) to be considered,   So..  a masters degree, with internship, is better than a masters degree alone!!!  Besides there are also a lot of faked documents floating around these days that are NOT verifiable... DO THE INTERNSHIP,,Prove yourself  and then   APPLY...
3411123_4	Welcome to the Catch-22 of education and educated people.  It gets worse, you can be credited/certified in one State, but not another without "further" testing and courses.  Then Standards differ from not just one State to the next, but from one place of higher learning to another.  There may be "universal precautions" with AIDS, but there is nothing universally accepted about education; experience or abilities.  I believe its called "hoop-jumping" and it is still a waste of human potential and knowledge.  Good luck to you and don't quit pursuing your dreams.
3411123_5	Have you tried starting your firm?
3411123_6	You think other countries accept American credentials?  I doubt it, unless they're desperate for a specific type of professional.. . Each country has different building materials and cultural and natural challenges.  If you're education is close enough to US standards, you should be able to quickly apply what you've learned in an internship (and make good $$$ while doing it, too!)  The the certification should be a breeze for you.
3411123_7	Standards vary from country to country. If i went to Italy although a CPA in the US, I could not immediately be employed at the same level. Do the internship, show what you got, my experience is that people outside the US have a far superior education than those here; but you have to prove it first.
3411123_8	I think maybe the question might be a little off.  In your particular position it might be true but in honesty in lots of positions such as doctors, they will usually be hired quicker than Americans as usually they will work cheaper although still making great wages.  Locally here, a J-1 doctor with no experience will hire in as soon as they enter the country for about 150K per year with another 100k in perks where an American doctor won't even consider an offer like that.  I saw a couple years back an American OBGYN hire in at a company with a 200K sign in bonus, $200K per year salary, 1/2 of the overall money she generated on top of that, $500/month cell phone allowance, and $700/month rental allowance.
2288606_1	Because Christians were Jews that believed Jesus was the savior.  Some Jews did not believe this.  They still continue to wait for the savior.  So those Jews that did believe Jesus was the savior, sected off and formed a new religion - Catholicism (Christianity).
2288606_8	In theory, you could say, if Catholicism came from Christianity, why are there still Christians around?. . Because some people believe one thing, and others believe something else, that's why!
2429491_1	I think that Disneyland is not to babyish for any individual. There is Space Mountain, Pirates of the Carribean, Matterhorn, Star Tours, and various other rides that are designed for the whole family and adults.  My husband and I went to Disney World, Magic Kingdom (which is the same as Disneyland), and we had a blast. We also went to Disneyland this past January.  I feel that Disney provides a good experience for any age group.
2429491_4	Disneyland is a lot of fun. Only if you don't like roller coasters.  They make all their rides suitable for kids like 2.
2429491_6	I will always love Disneyland.  I like looking around at the kids and knowing who's there for the 1st time and seeing the awe on their face.
2429491_9	I believe disneyland is geared  towards 5 yr olds.
2429491_10	i luv disneyland and not all rides are babyish i mean that one u got on was
2429491_15	Of course not.  Most people do not know this, but Walt Disney actually created Disneyland for adults!  He wanted a place where both children and adults could learn and have fun together.  Disney believed in being a child at heart.  Children search, discover, and are not embarrased to admit they have learned.  Disneyland was created as place of education, hope, and love to all people.  Embracing the child within is healthy and is something that should be explored by every individual, everyday.  I'm not naive enough to think that elements in Walt Disney's original plan for Disneyland have not been changed for business purposes, and there is the slowly spreading belief that Disney is for children, when Walt Disney firmly believed that any business geared directly toward children would not be successful.  So, no Disneyland is for everyone.  It's for discovering that sometimes fantasy is more real than reality.  . . One time a man was at Disneyland and sat on a bench next to another, older man who, at the time, was difficult to recognize.  The younger man mentioned how Disneyland kept you from reality, and the older man promptely answered that this park was reality, and it was everything outside of it, that was fantasy.  That older man was Walt Disney.. . So go enjoy Disneyland.  Learn the beautiful history behind It's a Small World, so you may enjoy it.  Understand it's appearance at the World's Fair.  Know what a step that World's Fair was in technology and the understanding of other cultures.  Learn and explore.  It's a small world after all, with a lot to learn in it.  And sing...  sing it's a small world.

1380654_35	I didn't know there was a copyright on the names...
1948821_0	It started centuries ago when someone wished for something and it came true, but at the expense of someone else. For example: Lets say: A woman wishes for lots of money so she could buy all the things her family needs, and a few days later, her husband, whom she loves dearly, dies in a car wreck. A week later she receives an insurance policy check in the amount of $ 100,000.00, (a life insurance policy she didn't know her husband had), well, she got her wish, she had all the money she wanted, ( but at the expense of her husband)!

4163358_12	Could be, ask yourself if it's just a local problem.  I'd say where I live is just a fine place as far as manners go, but 30 miles from here in a less economic city with many more poor people and churches, people are much ruder.
2994485_2	Because Taco Bell is giving away all their ancient secrets.. . Taco Bell is in fact the finest Mexican food that money can buy and they can't stand to see it sold so cheaply.. . It is pure envy and selfishness because they don't want to share their delicious gorditas and nachos bellgrande with us gringos.. . Did you know: the bell on the Taco Bell logo is the actual bell hung in the first church built by the Spanish in Mexico?  It was built near Mexico City to convert the Aztecs.. . So you see, everything about Taco Bell is authentic and goes right to the heart of Mexican culture.  Go there and immerse yourself in the Mexican experience:  Taste the history.  Savor the cross-cultural understanding.  Discover the soul of our neighbor to the south.  Make a run for the border.
2994485_5	I've never heard that they do. There are certainly enough Taco Bells around here, the suburbs east of Los Angeles, and they seem to do well enough. Most of us prefer places with much better food, though. Even Del Taco is better.

2095328_1	Congrats...nice phone.. . I have a Virgin Mobile Slider Sonic, and I plug my USB cable into the computer and just drag what i want to it. Mind you, that you are using a transflash or a Micro SD card, you can put whatever you want on the card, it might not (or in most cases, will not) show up on the phone.... . Your phone comes with a USB cable that hooks to your phone. while it's hooked up, your phone is off and in file transfer mode. Most likely, you need to be running Windows XP on your comp to use it, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to do cool things with it. (I think you can send people songs from your phone, but read the manual to be sure!). . By the way, be careful with your card, and try not to remove it from the phone too much if you don't need to. If you have to transfer it to a card reader, be careful, because Micro SD cards are VERY sensitive.. . Enjoy, and I hope this helps alittle.
1990217_1	because people try to understand what they want to know about islam in general for what they see in TV and what they hear.. That is wrong muslims call to peace and they dont tend to be bad people it's totaly the oppisite . Muslims love to live thier life and have fun although where ever we are we respect other people and have I high level of hospitality. We like to have great connections with other cultures and neighbors. (islam) is not the problem the people are the problem b&#92;c they dont understand what islam is really about . So these terrorists are those kind of people and there only a small part of the muslim sociaty.
1990217_5	The media everywhere love presenting it like that, I guess because so much of the media is conrolled by the American government.. It discourages people from finding out the real Islam for themselves, they just stereotype us all the time.
2506109_9	Before we dive into how wings keep airplanes up in the air, it's important that we take a look at four basic aerodynamic forces: lift, weight, thrust and drag. . .  . .  . . . Straight and Level Flight. In order for an airplane to fly straight and level, the following relationships must be true: . . Thrust = Drag . Lift = Weight . If, for any reason, the amount of drag becomes larger than the amount of thrust, the plane will slow down. If the thrust is increased so that it is greater than the drag, the plane will speed up. . Similarly, if the amount of lift drops below the weight of the airplane, the plane will descend. By increasing the lift, the pilot can make the airplane climb. . .  .  Thrust. Thrust is an aerodynamic force that must be created by an airplane in order to overcome the drag (notice that thrust and drag act in opposite directions in the figure above). Airplanes create thrust using propellers, jet engines or rockets. In the figure above, the thrust is being created with a propeller, which acts like a very powerful version of a household fan, pulling air past the blades.
3599049_0	Cloning involves producing an exact copy of  something ( in a biological sense this includes a cell or an entire organism / tissue). . . cloning occurs constantly in nature, by means of the production of genetically identical organisms via asexual reproduction. For example, in mitosis- 2 identical daughter cells are produced per cell division, binary fission- the method by which bacteria 'clone' themselves.. . We can hi-jack the cell's natural mechanisms to clone an animal/ cell.... . 1. a cell is chosen to be the host cell ( into which we will add DNA). 2.all its genetic material is removed. 3. the genetic material of another particular cell is injected into the first cell. 4. this cell is then stimulated ( electrically/ chemically) to start dividing.. 5. once stimulated the cell can be placed inside a female host and carried to gestation.. . while there seems to be endless possibilities with cloning, the success rates are relatively low.

2078255_3	To teach you a lesson, discipline you- this is the message a punishment is basically trying to say "Never do what got you to be punished in the first place again!".
2078255_4	Punishment can be used for several purposes. . Traditionally, in the US, punishment has been used as a form of deterrance. (i.e. someone commits a crime and gets sentenced to 20 years, the public see's this and the cost of the crime [the jailing] outweighs the benefit of the crime, which hopefully deters criminals to commit that same crime). There is General deterrance and specific deterrance. General detterance is following a chart of crimes and punishments. By this I mean there is determinant sentencing for each crime, no questions asked. . Specific sentencing is where the prosecution individualized each criminal. By this I mean that the person recieved indeterminate sentencing or perhaps makes a plea bargain. . The US is becoming more and more recognized for using both methods of punishment.
1156881_0	Constitutionality is the status of a law, a procedure, or an act's accordance with the laws or guidelines set forth in the applicable constitution. When one of these directly violates the constitution it is illegal, or more specifically unconstitutional. All the rest are considered constitutional until declared otherwise.. . An act (or statute) which is enacted as law either by the council of a city or county, by the legislature of a state or province, or by a national legislature, may be declared unconstitutional. When the proper court determines that the act in question conflicts with the constitution, it finds that law unconstitutional and declares it void in whole or in part. The portion of the law that is declared void is considered to be struck down, as the statute is considered to be struck from the statute books.
1156881_3	Unconstitutional means it's breacking the constitution (USA laws). Illegal means state laws. I think

2668911_2	Strep throat is caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes. (Most sore throats are caused by a virus & are associated with colds & flu.) Common symptoms of strep throat are sudden sore throat, high fever, fatigue, & swollen tonsils/lymph nodes. Symptoms of colds/flu that are usually not present in strep throat are cough & runny nose. Rapid diagnosis is important for 2 reasons -- First, unlike colds/flu, strep throat is readily treatable with antibiotics & second, several serious complications can occur after prolonged, untreated strep infection.
2668911_13	How do you know you have strep throat?. . If you do have it, it will probably go away on its own in about a week.  If you don't take antibiotics however, you run the risk of getting rheumatic fever which can cause damage to the valves inside your heart.  Chances are low, but definitely greater if you don't treat the strep throat.  If it were me, I would go see a doctor.. . A similar question was asked recently:. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiYkU1pXAqVWPU3fgPanNKfsy6IX?qid=1006060217410. . Oh yeah, about the bleach water gargle.  It will probably kill whatever bacteria it comes in contact it.  It will probably also severely irritate your throat.  There's a reason people use other things like hydrogen peroxide, salt water, or alcohol-based mouthwashes.
2668911_14	Strep throat is an infection caused by group A streptococcus bacteria, and it's very common among kids and teens. The symptoms of strep throat include fever, stomach pain, and red, swollen tonsils.. . Strep throat usually requires treatment with antibiotics. With the proper medical care - along with plenty of rest and fluids - your child should be back to school and play within a few days.. . How Does Strep Throat Spread?. Anybody can get strep throat, but it's most common in school-age kids and teens. It occurs most often during the school year when big groups of kids and teens are in close quarters.. . The bacteria that cause strep throat tend to hang out in the nose and throat, so normal activities like sneezing, coughing, or shaking hands can easily spread the strep infection from one person to another. That's why it's so important to teach your child the importance of hand washing - good hygiene can lessen your child's chances of getting contagious diseases like strep throat.. . What's the Difference Between Strep Throat and a Sore Throat?. Not all sore throats are step throats. Most episodes of sore throat - which can be accompanied by a runny nose, cough, hoarseness, and red eyes - are caused by viruses. Sore throats usually clear up on their own without requiring medical treatment.. . If your child has strep throat, he or she will start to develop other symptoms within about 3 days. Those symptoms can include:. . red and white patches in the throat . difficulty swallowing . tender or swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck . red and enlarged tonsils . headache . lower stomach pain . fever . general discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling . loss of appetite and nausea . rash . Diagnosing Strep Throat. If your child's throat is sore and he or she has other strep throat symptoms, it's a good idea to call your child's doctor. The doctor will likely do a rapid strep test in the office, using a cotton swab to take a sample of the fluids at the back of your child's throat. The test only takes about 5 minutes. If it's positive, your child has strep throat. If the test is negative, the doctor will send a sample to a lab for a throat culture. The results are usually available within a few days.. . Treating Strep Throat. In most cases, doctors prescribe about 10 days of antibiotic medication to treat strep throat. Within about 24 hours after your child starts taking the antibiotics, his or her temperature will probably be back to normal, and your child will no longer be contagious. By the second or third day after taking antibiotics, the other symptoms should start to go away, too.. . Even though your child may not feel sick at that point, it's very important that he or she finish the antibiotic prescription. If your child stops taking antibiotics too soon, bacteria can remain in the throat and the symptoms can return.. . If your child is not treated for strep throat, he or she is most infectious when the symptoms are the most severe but could remain contagious for up to 21 days. Lack of treatment - or not finishing the prescribed course of antibiotics - also could put your child at risk for other health problems, such as rheumatic fever (which can cause permanent damage to the heart), scarlet fever, blood infections, or kidney disease.. . To prevent your sick child from spreading strep throat to others in your home, keep his or her eating utensils, dishes, and drinking glasses separate from those that everyone else is using. Wash them in hot, soapy water after each use. Also, make sure your child doesn't share food, drinks, napkins, handkerchiefs, or towels with other family members. Make sure your child covers his or her mouth and nose during a sneeze or a cough to prevent passing infectious fluid droplets to someone else.. . Caring for Your Child With Strep Throat. There's plenty you can do to help your child feel better. To prevent dehydration, make sure your child drink

2543207_7	Heat is vibration of particles, but the catalyst for making those particles vibrate can be many things, from friction to chemical. One such catalyst, light, is constantly passing through almost every area of the universe at all times, and when this light impacts matter, heat results. However this heat is irrelevant to our conversation, because your asking about empty space (which is almost impossible to find and/or create). The fact is this:. How do we know the temperature of an area of space, or more accurately how far from absolute zero it is, without introducing some piece of matter that is designed to determine the information we seek? The introduction of such a device would receive impacts from the light passing through said space field, corrupting the temperature reading.. The point of this is that empty space does have a temperature close to ab zero (not ab zero due to dark energy radiating heat), empty space is an improbable eventuality, and if it did or does ever happen no-one will be there to observe it. besides that, space is not empty and thus is not ab zero. . as a side note, particles are a vibration of impure energy, and are only seen because the energy is moving at the speed of light giving the illusion that it is material. Therefore, even matter is just space that is not empty, and thus is not ab zero.
2543207_8	Because there would have to be absolutely no heat anywhere... even in empty space, there are still billions and billions of stars around the empty space creating heat.  Therefore, it could be a billionth of a degree but never absolute zero.

3287239_0	I get what you're saying, most white people will say that their not racist when they really are. I think most white people are racist because they want to keep everyone down for some reason.

3301173_0	Each province has its own regulations, but a lot of them are based on american standards for Ashpahlts and rigid pavements.  The crust or surface course is actually only one of several layers of asphalt and aggregate the make up the roadway.  The thichness of each of the layers is depedent upon the underlying soil, the conditions that the highway will face and the use of the high way including the amount of traffic but especially truck traffic as they do the most damage to the road surface.  This data is then converted to an ESAL equivalent 80 kN single axle load and the thicknesses of various layers can be looked up in a series of tables.
3301173_1	The answer given by Aaron G above is very succinct and accurate.  This is also the way we design highways in the UK, indeed some of our design codes share a common heritage with your own.. .

230487_0	Its called a manometer. A U shaped device half full of water with on end connected to, for example, an air duct and the other end open to the atmosphere. The pressure in the duct will force the water in the manometer up the atmospheric side so many inches. The pressure is then measured in inches of water.
230487_2	It is a unit of pressure. In air ducts the pressure measured is very low and the can use a column of water. eg if the air pressure will move a column of water 3 inches then the pressure is 3 inches water (column). Approx 27 inches of water is one pound per square inch(psi)
1623623_0	1. Make sure you have the tires properly inflated.. 2. Make sure all of the filters (air filter and fuel filter) are clean.. 3. Avoid accelerating hard from a stop.
1623623_1	I believe thaere are add on to any car that can help but I know for sure that there is a mufler that helps a little
1623623_2	Make sure you change the oil, air filter, tires are inflated to the right pressure, don't put allot of weight in the car. and use the correct type of gas recommended for the car.
1623623_3	Be light footed on the gas pedal... smooth acceleration... renew air filter... OHC gaps correct gaps... clean and in good condition spark plugs... tune carb/fuel injection system.  That would do it. Driving around in a car out of tune is expensive on fuel !!  A car out of tune will have lower performance and the driver, to compensate for that,  instinctively uses more gas -- ie. heavier on the gas pedal.  Nearly forgot, take a compression test and all pistons. They  should have similar compression readings, around the 150 psi mark (check manufacturer's data for precise figure)
1977915_9	At the end of the last book of Greek mythology, it says; And it came to pass that the gods were mortal after all and they all died. Then came a true god whose name was Christ.

852628_1	No.  History repeats itself because humans are stupid and don't learn from their mistakes.
852628_6	You could say that history repeats itself when the same set of variables or series of events are set into motion, and for one reason or another, past experience hasn't taught us to approach that series of events differently than we did the first time.. . I don't think it has anything to do with Astronomy though.

3501196_2	The Planetary Hours are an ancient system in which one of the seven traditional naked eye planets is given rulership over each day and various parts of the day. Monday is always the Day of the Moon. Tuesday is the day of Mars, Wednesday is ruled by Mercury, Thursday is Jupiter's day, Friday is the day of Venus, Saturday is the day of Saturn, and Sunday is the day of the Sun.. . Each planetary day begins at sunrise, and ends at the next day's sunrise. For example, Sunrise on Saturday is the beginning of the day of Saturn. Before sunrise on Saturday, you are still under the day of Venus.. . The day is divided into two parts; the day (time between sunrise and sunset) and the night (time between sunset and tomorrow's sunrise). Each part of the day is then divided into 12 equal parts, for a total of 24 (unequal) hours.. . The first planetary hour of the day is always the same as the planetary day; so sunrise on Monday is the beginning of both the day of the Moon and the hour of the Moon. The hours repeat infinitely in this order:. . *Saturn. *Jupiter. *Mars. *Sun. *Venus. *Mercury. *Moon. . . So the second planetary hour of the day of the Moon is the hour of Saturn, the third would be the hour of Jupiter, and so on.

778164_2	People being rude and inconsiderate, looking down on others, some people not parenting letting their kids do as they please, people being influenced by others, being followers instead of leaders...people thinking their opinion is the only right opinion and being completely close-minded to others opinions, judging other people, criticizing other people for various reasons-their looks, beliefs, orientation, religion,etc. There are so many observations I have witnessed about humans in general.
72439_7	Manhole covers are round so that they would not fall into the hole. If it were a sqaure, the cover could fall in if placed diagonally. If it were a triagle, the cover could just fall in perpendicularly. However, if it were a circle, it cannot fall in because it is the same shape all round. No matter what angle, it cannot fall in.

3576354_3	When your wife got the service, I'm sure she had to sign something that said they would bill the insurance company as a courtesy, but she was ultimately responsible for the payment. If you hire a lawyer, you'd end up paying $200/hr to him and also the medical bill. Maybe she should find out from the insurance company why they refused to pay the bill first. It's not the job of the medical providers to go after the insurance company. She should have taken care of it earlier.
1593316_4	I know this is not a recipe but, I got a food processor and the first time I used it for a bar-be-que, i could have farted sparks!!!! When having a dinner party, bar-be-que, etc., the processor is the most magical thing in the world. Remember to use it for "mundane" tasks. I prep all my veggies (chopped onion, carrot, celery, egg, etc.)Use those little chinese soup containers for the chopped veges for salads. you can do it all in under 5 minutes, they are uniform, and your hands don't smell. Tuna salad is also great in there, you use less mayo and it is magnificent. White chunk tuna, onion, celery, relish, cracked black pepper. Add tuna and mayo last once everything is all chopped up. Have fun. the best part is making stuff up yourself!!

1248486_10	First, "Muslims" do not "hate the West" that is a stupid argument to make.  . . Second, The "West" surely wants people to think stupid like that though. The U.S. government has already attacked the Islamic faith by desecrating the Koran in its prisons, and humiliating Muslim detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan with pornographic material--not to mention torturing and sometimes murdering them. The U.S. has also backed Israel’s repression of Palestinians--joining most recently in the threats against Hamas after the Islamist party won the Palestinian legislative elections.. . At home, the U.S. government used the September 11 attacks to launch a witch-hunt, complete with FBI “interviews” of thousands of Arab and Muslim men, secret detentions, deportations and systematic racial profiling.

1996650_5	I think we all recognize that the differences between the parties are small. The two-party system is also so ingrained that it will be almost impossible to start a 3rd party that can really compete.  . . To me, you should look at your local representatives (State and Federal Congressmen and Senators).  Do those individuals have the same beliefs as you?  If not, work hard to get someone else into their office at the next election.  We cannot change the whole system at once, but we can elect people who are not career politicians, or at least people who have the same beliefs as us, and will fight to fix things, one position at a time.. . It is the politicians currently in office who made it the way it is.  Change them!
638670_33	Most of the previous answers are correct, it takes too much money. . What to do something about it? . . Let's start a DON'T RE-ELECT ANYONE campaign, especially for Federal politics. . . All of out US Senators & Congress people have only one goal. It is the same goal, to be re-elected.  Neither side truly cares about doing the right thing or they'd do it.. . We need to get back to the principals that made our county great. Most all of us have those principals, but until we get back to a system where being elected to serve is a duty, not a livelihood. . At our countries inception it was only the successful landowners or business owners who were elected. Most of them lost their land or business because they were not there to manage it. Yet they served because it was their duty. . VOTE OUT ALL INCUMBENTS.

1624980_13	Because their parents want them to be allowed to express themselves through art and cinema classes and enjoy school and pretend they speak 6 languages.  Parents need to live in a world of reality regarding their kids growing up - the schools just give the parents what they demand.
1624980_17	Because the school system is outdated. It is set up to teach the basics like math, spelling, geography, etc. Some schools do touch upon things like loans and budgeting but most don't. Also it seems many students are more interested in their social lives, What Paris or Lyndsey did in the tabloids than what is going on in the world. Just ask a teen what states border theirs and 90% will not know the answer. Parents need to teach their children life nessesities, not the schools.
2418598_0	a lot of studies have shown that overal brain size isnt as important as complexity and size of the outer layer of the brain, the crerebral cortex.. it is pretty much known that this part of the brain carries out the complex "thought" and ability to put things together that would eventually add up to be wisdom. another huge factor, probably more important, is live experience.. not just the top layer, obvious things, but the underlying developmental processes that every human goes through. there are tons of things that shape a persons mind, ability, level of conciousness, clarity, etc
2418598_1	experiance
2418598_2	Can we talk about IQ? Partially due to family genes i believe.. But mostly still depends on the environment and experience of the child.. This made me think about another question. Do u guys think that brain size do has effect on the itelligence? According to the record, Genius Einstein has a bigger brain size than normal people..
2418598_3	The morphology of the brain is mostly the same. But your preception, inteligence, memory, everything really are affected by the neuaral connections inside the brain. The connections form according to need and use and are uniqe to each individual: they depend on your personal expirience and so on.
2418598_4	well, there was a big debate about that within the last year with the president of Harvard, but...I don't want to get into that.... . I think Sandra Cisneros said it best "We are the Sum of Our Experiences".  This is where I adapt my view from, our wisdom varies because of the things we have experienced.
2418598_5	some people are wiser than others .
2418598_6	education, enviroment, life experiences, who you hang around --- hang out with smart people and you will have more wisdom.
2418598_7	Knowledge is just accretion of data...Wisdom is more akin to intuition.... .   As you seem interested in the physiognomy of the brain-we are speaking more of the linking "dendrites" organized well and orchestrating...rather than the sheer volume of neurons.... .   Observe the brain activity of a symphony conductor leading a composition he has composed...he will be using more of his brain and more efficiently.... .   Yet there are more subtle levels such as "body awareness"...not all thinking...and more precisely "intuition" is bound to the activity of the brain alone...
2418598_8	it is not HOW BIG your brain is (since size of human brain is almost the same), it is HOW MUCH you use it. . how we brought up and how we're educated means a lot in shaping a person's thinking. if someone is learning by SPOON-FEEDING him with knowledge, he only know what's being fed to him. if he was trained to think a lot and try a lot, the accumulation of his experiences will teach him to be wiser. . it is all about how often we EXERCISE our brains.
2418598_9	life experiences shape wisdom, but more information grows the brain, plus some people just have big heads =)

225575_0	that someone hasn't dried behind their ears
225575_1	When you are born you are wet. You then are dried off. This idea was extrapolated to mean a young inexperienced individual. Another term might be a tenderfoot.
225575_2	Naive..it refers to a baby just being born..and is literally wet behind the ears from..well..fluids!!
225575_3	It implies that somebody is juvenile, like they are still wet behind the ears
225575_4	Young, naive, inexperienced.  I would assume having something to do with when things are born behind the ears dry last.
225575_5	inexperienced!
225575_6	New, inexperienced, a rookie, someone who hasn't got the experiences others have ie a beginner
225575_7	The meaning is to be young, juvenile, naive, inexperienced, immature and refers to the fact that a newborn is still wet everywhere, but particularly "behind the ears", after birth (having not been "cleaned" yet).
225575_8	It means you are wet behind the ears and really need to dry yourself properly or you will end up chapping yourself. Try using a towel or some talc to make sure they are extra dry...
225575_9	amatuer, novice, naive, new to something.. Why? I don't know but would guess it has something to do with being newborn or something
225575_10	means very young or very inexperienced
225575_11	it means someone who is young or inexperienced.
225575_12	Immature, inexperienced, as in How can you take instructions from Tom? He's still wet behind the ears. This term alludes to the fact that the last place to dry in a newborn colt or calf is the indentation behind its ears. [Early 1900s]

225575_21	It means young, inexperienced and naive.  It implies that you are so young, you've not dried out yet from being in the womb - still wet behind the ears.

1947254_13	Religion, my dear friend, is man-made... or didn't you know that?. Christianity is not a "religion". With religion, you have man-made rules, rituals, laws, ceremonies, etc. Some of the greatest atrocities were done in the "name" of Christianity, but were in fact one man's, (or one church's), hunger for power and domination. I'll bet you even think that Catholicism is Christianity? If so, I can see why you think as you do! It is one of the biggest pagan religions around! True Christians don't have a religion. Their inspiration comes from the Word of God, not man! A true Christian seeks to be as Jesus was, (and is!).. So... how much history have you studied?. (Sounds like you've already made up your mind regardless?!)

104625_0	the difference between regular lemonade and pink lemonade is that pink lemonade is PiNK. duuh.
104625_6	PInk lemonade gets it color, and therefore its name, from the addition of another juice into the mix. Usually strawberry, cherry, or cranberry.
104625_9	i like lemonade better than pink lemonade because pink lemonade is sweet and lemonade is kinda sour and sweet at the same time. how it gets pink i think they put food coloring in it but i am not sure.
104625_12	Pink lemonade is usually sweeter, and has some dyes added to make it pink.
104625_14	Artifical coloring...pink tends to be a bit sweeter.  The naturally yellow lemonade is traditionally served more tart.
104625_23	An approximate recipe for U.S. and Canadian lemonade is to mix equal volumes of lemon juice and sugar and add water to taste, approximately four times as much water as lemon juice.. . A pink lemonade variation can be produced by adding red food coloring or grenadine syrup. Traditionally, beet juice provided the pink color; so little is needed that the flavor of the drink remains largely unchanged. This beverage may have originated as a replacement for "Indian lemonade," a cold infusion of red sumac berries, sometimes sweetened with maple sugar. Sumac beverages have a taste and appearance similar to pink lemonade, and were popular with Native Americans and early European settlers.

949154_6	The butler is a senior servant in a large household. Usually the butler is the most senior staff member, although in the great houses of the past, the household was sometimes divided into departments with the butler in charge of the dining room (including the wine cellar) and pantry, and sometimes the entire parlour floor, and a housekeeper who was in charge of the whole house and its appearance. Housekeepers are occasionally portrayed in literature as being the most senior staff member and as even making recommendations for the hiring of the butler.

Housekeepers are occasionally portrayed in literature as being the most senior staff member and as even making recommendations for the hiring of the butler.. . In modern houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as Majordomo, Butler Administrator, Staff Manager, Estate Manager and Head of Household Staff are sometimes given.. . The word "butler" derives from the Old French "bouteillier", (meaning "cup bearer"), from "bouteille", ("bottle"). The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages (which in ancient times represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.). . In Britain the butler was originally a middle ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries the butler gradually became the usually senior male member of a household's staff (in the very grandest households there was sometimes a house steward senior to the butler into the 19th century). Butlers used to always be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.. . The earliest literary mention of a butler is probably that of the man whose release from prison was predicted by Joseph in the biblical account of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the Pharaoh's servants.. . In London there remains only one hotel which offers a private butler service, The Lanesborough Hotel.

In this case the butler may have been either subordinate or equal to the housekeeper. .... . In the Madras and Bombay Presidencies this is the title usually applied to the head-servant of any English or quasi-English household. He generally makes the daily market, has charge of domestic stores, and superintends the table. As his profession is one which affords a large scope for feathering a nest at the expense of a foreign master, it is often followed at Madras by men of comparatively good caste.

Best thing is this that Split AC is very quiet as compared to Window's a jet engine.. secondly you don't need a big hole just a little one that u can say connector between both indoor and outdoor unit. And that small hole will also behind that indoor unit so it will also not visible as well.. . Moreover SPLIT AC that is costly in price but looks beautiful and noiseless.
2768539_1	unlike window ac ,split ac is easier to instal as only the air inlet panel has to be taken care of  in the interiors whereas the other mechanical parts can be fitted outdoors as per the convenience.Hence the name ....

Any woman was theirs, they paid for nothing, they were bowed down to.  After the war, those who were left alive and recognized were scorned.  Treated like vermin.  No one would have anything to do with them.  Kind of like getting kicked off of the varsity football team huh?

860893_5	Good question.. I will turn your question around. It is cunningness that is associated with intelligence. The person who is cunning will also be intelligent. An intelligent person may not be cunning.. . Intelligent is a person . 1. who does rational things and avoids irrational things. 2. Has a sound knowledge of something. 3. Has the capacity to acquire the knowledge of things. . Mind it, there can be intelligent gadgets too, which behave rationally. Rational also means logical. Such gadgets behave logically. That's why you have "fuzzy logic" found in many gadgets. Besides, there is something called artificial intelligence. Logic that is computed artificially. In all the senses, it is rationality that is intelligence. . . Cunningness : The ability to take immoral advantage of a situation such that others might even suffer. . . You cannot be non-intelligent but cunning, because cunningness involves a lot of logic. Infact it requires a logic superior than normal intelligent people. Many a times even intelligent people are conned (a word with same root as cunning). So, it is cunningness that is associated with intelligence.. . Intelligence is not always used for self gain only. The innovations, inventions and discoveries that make our life easy and make us SOCIAL from SAVAGE are the result of human intelligence (and not of human cunningness). So, there you see the difference.. . There can be (there should be, amen) a society with only intelligent people without anyone being cunning. But there cannot be a society with only cunning people but noone intelligent.

1035857_0	Another provocative question from Nicholas "meathead" Rage. Liberals as you call us are not quick to defend that piece of sh't, we just want our leaders to thoroughly think out any military operation regardless of reason.

Meanwhile North Korea is testing  long range missles that could hit Alaska or Hawaii, Good job Georgie Boy, we feel much safer now.
1035857_1	I don't understand it either they have been harping on the fact we haven't found WMD's then we do and they trivialize them. The fact is whether old or not they are still extremely dangerous and are still WMD's, ask the Lib's if we can dispose of them in their backyard and see if they agree. Most people with common sense knew there were WMD's, remember two weeks before the war started the Russian's warned Saddam and there were survelliance photos of semi's with trailers crossing the border into Syria? Strange but the Dem/Lib won't discuss that either. And this lame arguement that only the most idiotic of lefties will believe 'that those are not the WMD's we went to war for', is the worst that Dem/Lib's are touting, even their own supporters are saying its lame....really, no matter if we find WMD's with a note saying "these are the ones the American's are going to start a war over, signed Saddam Hussein"  the Dem/Lib's will come up with some excuse....sounds kind of like the 'I did not inhale and I did not have sexual relations with that woman and what do you mean by 'is'"  the leaders of the Democratic Party are doing a grave disservice to the good and honest Democrats and it will show in the next election.
1035857_2	Sadaam was only doing what this country has been doing for years.  Controlling his people to get them to do what he wanted them to do.  Why is a country not allowed to have weapons. If you don't think that the U.S. has "weapons of mass destruction" somewhere, I've got some land I want to sell you in China. It's all about checks and balances, and Sadaam would not conform. He is a threat,  therefore he must be contained. Now because he would not cooperate with the US's "agenda" he's a tyrant. I could care less about Sadaam, but you've got to be brainwashed to not see parralels between the two governments. I don't think anyone's defending Sadaam, I think its more of a "the pot calling the kettle black" issue.
1035857_3	Nevr mind. I jsut saw what I wanted to see. Ignore it.
1035857_4	I consider myself a liberal, and i wouldn't dream of defending Sadaam.  . However, i think blanket statements very rarely, if ever, show a complete picture.  This whole WMD thing is a complex issue, and someone who points out that some of these things were old, aren't defending Sadaam, they are merely pointing out that the WMD argument for going to war isn't as strong as Bush would have us believe.  . This using of the words liberal and conservative as if they are evil epitaphs is not only offensive, but it gets in the way of actual discussions of issues that Are complex and do Not have easy answers.  Debate is the way to find these answers, and to generalize someone in such a way and attack them is juvenile.  Think of the junior high cafeteria, two girls in an argument, one makes a valid point, the other says, "well you're ugly, so there!"  and suddenly the whole argument is overshadowed by the personal insult.  The argument isn't solved and both people get hurt.  One is embarrassed and the other is seen as a bitch.  . that is exactly what is happening in this liberal/conservative war.. if you want people to see things the way you do, present a coherent argument, and just maybe you'll change someone's mind.
1035857_5	We aren't defending Suddam. We are saying the reason for going to war was a fabrication to gain public support. Face it no matter how you spin it this war was started so that W's defense friends could fatten their wallets, George could tell his father that "No man can try kill his father and get away with it. The only value to this war is that it has drawn a large number of terrorists to Iraq. . Such a high price to pay for the citizens of Iraq. and other countries. Oh yes, It's about the oil. Quit blaming the Liberals for everything. Conservatives have spent to much, blamed everyone but themselves, and pray to God to help them out of this mess.
1035857_6	WASHINGTON — The United States has found 500 chemical weapons in Iraq since 2003, and more weapons of mass destruction are likely to be uncovered, two Republican lawmakers said Wednesday.. . My problem with this is the fact that since 2003, our president has been lying to us.  We were still under the impression of no WMDs.  However, this report would have me believe that our administration has been sitting on this evidence for 3 years.  Why does it not bother you that our president may have been lying to us?

Whereas, repbulicans view these people as the enemy of our nation.. . Ok, so I took a cheap shot at good ol' Al Gore...it's a joke.
1035857_9	I have to laugh everytime a Republican points to something that has to do with nothing, and act like it "proves" something. . . "Hey, Abu Abbas is in Iraq. There's that terrorism link Bush was talking about.". . "Hey, we found some 20 year old munitions. There's that weapons program Bush was talking about.". . Let's make it simple. Saddam was a bad guy, to most of his own people. But Bush lied to America about him being an imminent threat to America.. . Saddam killed thousands of his own people, but all of the mass graves right-wing idiots point to are from the periods when Saddam was fighting a virtual civil war. We don't say "Lincoln is evil, he killed hundreds of thousands of Americans", now do we? Bush Sr. promised we'd help overthrow Saddam. The people rose up, Bush did nothing, and Saddam quashed the insurgency. Does that make Saddam a good guy? No. But you at least need to have some f'n context.. . There are lots of bad guys in the world. I'm glad Saddam is out of power. But if Americans had been told before the war, "We're going to spend $300 billion to remove a bad guy who's not an eminent threat, and in the process, create (not stop, but CREATE) an entire generation of Iraqi terrorists, and fuel hatred of America throughout the Middle East and the world", no one in their right mind would have supported that course of action.

I didn't have my friends in the Supreme Court lie to get you in the White House just so you can mess around on Yahoo chat!!! Who cares about Saddam. he was just a puppet, all we wanted to do was use him as an excuse to invade Iraq.Stop messing with the American public trying to defend yourself.  That's too late for that...Look at your approval ratings! Who cares. You don't have to run for office again.  We were about oil and making money all along, son.  Now run along and kiss some Saudi behinds for me....Before I spank yours!
1035857_11	I think it's more of a case that we will not support Bush, so it just sounds like we are defending Saddam.  . . Everything is so black and white here- no one can appreciate the multitudes of gray in the world.. . I don't think anyone thought Saddam was a "good guy"
1035857_12	liberals dont defend sadam. liberals know the truth- sadam was weak and had lost alot of power since the first gulf war. he had no navy, no battle ships, a small airport with no firghter jets, his army was weak, and he had no wmds. the sanctions were working- source: un inspector hans blitz who is neither a liberal or conservative. sadam was a threat in the 80's where he was at the height of his power, and it's funny becasue in the 80's sadam was friends with the u.s. source- photos of him with rumsfield. also we backed him and funded his war against iran. during the sadam trial he mentioned that he hates bush but regean was a great president-becasue regean backed him. you don't know this becasue your not opening your mind from the brainwashing. they are worst dictators to go after such as north koreas, but i forgot north korea doesn't have oil! also sadam was enemies with bin laden because sadam saw bin laden as a lunatic.
1035857_13	We aren't defending him at all. We're just stating facts. Why did we go into Iraq? I've heard time and again it was for WMD's and then sometimes I hear it's because of an Al Qaida connection. Which is it? We wouldn't have an issue if we were told the truth and they were honest with us. There is nothing but backhandedness going on in that White House and look who you're quoting...fox news. Yeah they're balanced...sure they are. There are plenty of republicans out there that are also fed up with the lies that this administration has told us. It's not a matter of whether or not Kerry won...that's done and over with. I haven't heard too many people complaining about Kerry not winning until I listen to people like you. I'm aware of the article Rolling stone did about the "voting problems" in Ohio. Maybe you should read that and then make an informed decision. And another thing...why is it ok for us to make WMD's (even though we're not supposed to) and no one else is allowed? I'm not saying I want them to be made but if we signed an agreement which we did, shouldn't we be following it too? Would it be ok if someone else invaded our country because there is a possibility for manufacturing WMD's
1035857_14	Because anyone who is against America (especially republicans) is a freind of theirs.
1035857_15	I'm moderately liberal and I don't and would not defend Saddam.. . I think the question is:Why do conservative extremists posing as moderates ask questions that actually apply to few if any actual liberals?
1035857_16	... defending Saddam? All we are trying to do is figure out what is going on?. . Why can't republicans use logic or reason when asking a question? If you question something it doesn't mean that you "love the other side.". . Many conservatives were against World War II at the time.... does that mean that they loved Hitler? Only today's conservatives would think that way...
1035857_17	Lupin IV, How dare you say I am against America because I am a republican. Looks like you haven't learned anything from your liberal friends about political correctness. Very surprising I might add.

I feel that if we took all of their "good" ideas rolled them into one we would have such a better world. but anyways..... . . As for Saddam. I wouldn't defend that s.o.s. if my life depended on it. If I were the one to find him in his little hole. I would have shot him dead right there and then. Wanted: Saddam Dead or Alive. I would choose Dead. He does NOT deserve a fair trial nor another breath of fresh air.

3513905_7	It may not be one of life’s deepest mysteries, but as scientific conundrums go, it has a peculiar staying power. Why is yawning contagious? .   Researchers recently found that yawning isn’t only catching among people; it is also among chimpanzees.No one has devised a fully convincing explanation of why.. . Compounding the mystery is the odd way in which the contagious power of yawning is largely unconscious. We can see someone yawn, yearn to replicate the action ourselves, and do it, all without thinking about it. Other times we’re aware it is happening, though it still floats somewhere beneath the realm of reason and of purposeful actions.. . So what gives? In an effort to find the answer, the Finnish government recently funded a brain scanning study. The results turned up some hard-to-interpret, possible clues. It also confirmed the obvious: yawn contagion is largely unconscious. Wherever it might affect the brain, it bypasses the known brain circuitry for consciously analyzing and mimicking other people’s actions.. . This circuitry is called the “mirror-neuron system,” because it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing. . . Mirror neurons typically become active when a person consciously imitates an action of someone else, a process associated with learning. But they seem to play no role in yawn contagiousness, the researchers in the new study found. The cells are have no extra activity during contagious yawning compared with during other non-contagious facial movements, they observed.. . Brain activity “associated with viewing another person yawn seems to circumvent the essential parts of the MNS [mirror neuron system], in line with the nature of contagious yawns as automatically released behavioural acts—rather than truly imitated motor patterns that would require detailed action understanding,” wrote the researchers, with the Helsinki University of Technology and the Research Centre Jülich, Germany. The findings are published in the February issue of the research journal Neuroimage.. . But if seeing someone yawn doesn’t activate these centers, what does it do to the brain? The researchers found that it appears to strongly activate at least one brain area, called the superior temporal sulcus. But this activation was unrelated to any desire to yawn in response, so it may be irrelevant to the contagion question, the researchers added.. . Possibly more significant, they wrote, was the apparent deactivation of a second brain area, called the left periamygdalar region. The more strongly a participant reported wanting to yawn in response to another person’s yawn, the stronger was this deactivation. . . “This finding represents the first known neurophysiological signature of perceived yawn contagiousness,” the researchers wrote.. . Exactly what the finding means is less clear, they acknowledged. The periamygdalar region is a zone that lies alongside the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep in the brain in the area of the side of the head. The periamygdalar region has been linked to the unconscious analysis of emotional expressions in faces. Why it would be deactivated in tandem with yawn contagion is unclear, the researchers said.. . One thing seems clear from the study is that “contagious yawning does not rely on brain mechanisms of action understanding,” wrote one of the researchers, Riitta Hari of the Helsinki University of Technology, in a recent email. Rather, she continued, it seems to be an “‘automatically’ released (and most likely very archaic) motor pattern,” or sequence of physical actions.. . In the study, volunteers looked at videos of actors yawning or making other mouth movements. Meanwhile their brains were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a system that shows the amount of activity or work going on in various brain areas ba

4394257_0	Most of Earth's internal heat is caused by radioactive decay of various elements located there. Additional heat comes from the tremendous compression of almost 4,000 miles of rock surrounding Earth's center.
4394257_6	One theory is that radioactive decay of the primordial elements inside the Earth, U-238, Th-232, and U-235 and their radioactive products generate thermal energy (heat)and this heat is trapped inside causing the core to be so hot
4394257_7	the heat at the core of the earth is a remnant of the earths formation  it is theoriuzed that the earth formed from materials ranging in size from small particles like dust to large clumps of materials the size of houses.  When these materials collected into a sphere heat was produced as they impacted for the first few hundred million years the earth was a ball of molten rock.  the crust quickly cooled but the core remains in a molten state. as a side note: mars informed in the same way because it is slightly smaller it lost its heat more quickly and now has a solid core.

For lamb chops here is my favorite recipe. 4 lamb shoulder chop, cut 1- 1.5 inches thick . 1 teaspoon salt . 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper . 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon . 1small can canned crushed pineapple in juice . 1/2 cup jalapeno jelly" or mint jelly for the faint of heart". 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice . 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard .  . . Directions:. . Sprinkle lamb shoulder chops with mixture of salt, pepper and cinnamon. Combine  remaining ingredients in small saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring until jelly is melted.  Grill lamb chops 4 inches from source of heat, 11 to 13 minutes. Spoon sauce over  lamb last 5 minutes of cooking time.

793463_0	Never underestimate the power of a perfectly roasted chicken. A classic example of the beauty of simplicity, roast chicken has the power to comfort, to satisfy, and to impress. The inviting aroma of a juicy roasting bird is enough to make anyone's mouth water, and by the time the chicken emerges from the oven, golden crispy skin sliced through to reveal the tender, moist meat within, everyone will be crazy with anticipation. You don't need to tell them how easy it was to make. Just smile and let them exalt you.. . A Many-Splendored Bird. Roasting a chicken takes a little longer than some other methods of cooking this universally popular bird, but it actually requires very little preparation time-it's mostly just a matter of patience in waiting for the bundle of joy to finish roasting. Another merit of roast chicken is that the leftovers just keep on giving. Roasting two chickens is just as easy as roasting one chicken, and today's roast chicken dinner is tomorrow's chicken enchiladas, chicken soup, chicken salad, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, or chicken sandwich. As if that weren't enough, roast chicken is wonderfully economical, too! Pound for pound, whole chickens are much cheaper than a package of chicken breasts, thighs, or legs.. . Skin is In. Chicken skin contains a great deal of fat, and many people are in the habit of removing it in order to avoid the extra calories. Crispy, fragrant roast chicken skin is absolutely delicious, and, many people insist, the best part of the roast chicken. If you choose to pass up the temptation, though, you still need to leave the skin on the chicken during roasting. Roasting a skinless bird is an exercise in futility. The skin holds in moisture and juiciness. If you skin the chicken before you roast it, the meat will become bone-dry long before it's cooked through. You can carve the chicken then remove the skin from your portion as you see fit. Don't worry-there is no significant difference in calories between removing the skin before or after cooking!. . Divine Brine. One secret to really flavorful, juicy roast chicken is brining-i.e., soaking in salt water. Kosher chickens are always brined before selling; this is one of the reasons that kosher birds tend to taste better. To brine a chicken, dissolve 1/2 cup kosher salt in 1/2 gallon of water, immerse the chicken in the solution and place immediately in the refrigerator. You should let it soak for at least 3 hours, but overnight is great too. When you're ready to cook the chicken, pour out the brine, rinse the chicken cold running water so it won't taste excessively salty, then pat it dry with paper towels. You can still achieve a delicious roast chicken even without brining, but do give it a try sometime. You'll love the results.. . Dress it Up. If you decide to forego the brining step, just remove the chicken from the package, rinse it with cool water, and then pat it dry with paper towels. Rinsing removes residue and some surface bacteria, and drying off the chicken ensures that the skin will brown. Now for the fun part: seasoning! A chicken roasted with nothing but salt, pepper, and butter is very tasty indeed, but it's also easy to build on top of these simple flavors. Herbs are always a good idea. You can chop them up and tuck them under the chicken's skin along with a few pats of butter, or you can simply stuff handfuls of them into the chicken cavity. Wedges of aromatic fruits such as lemons or oranges, and aromatic vegetables such as onions and garlic are great to stuff in with the herbs as well. Filling the cavity with good-smelling things will perfume the bird as it roasts, infusing the meat with incomparable flavor.. . Another approach you can use is to make a blend of dried or fresh ground spices and rub them under the chicken's skin and inside the cavity. For a Southwestern flavor, try chile powder or pureed fresh chiles, cumin, and sage. For an Indian-inspired bird,

Any more time than needed will bring out the juices and you are gonna end up having cardboard instead of chicken.

3806560_1	The shoot from the germinating seed travels in the direction where it encounters the least resistance.. . Going deeper underground or to the sides, it finds the soil too tightly packed. Ditto to the sides. But upward - the direction from which it was planted - the soil is looser.. . Try this experiment:  get a seed and plant it in some earth, up against the side of a transparent container.  Use a good-sized amount - enough to *pack* the soil, very deep and very hard, overtop the seed.. . Basically, you want to encase that poor seed in what amounts to a brick of soil. Keep the exposed side - the side where the seed is against the glass - away from the light. Best to just drap a towel over the container whenever you're not directly observing it.. . Then wait. The seed will probably sprout, but it'll take a long time to breach the surface - if it ever manages.
3806560_12	I'm always amazed at some of the silly answers I see on here.  I wonder if people are that dumb or trying to be funny.  OK well I majored in Biology and took lots of botany classes.  Seeds germinate and grow towards a light source.  That's why you see them curve and turn if you leave them in a window where they have to move to get to the light source.  They are also able to detect gravity and they use that detection method to direct the roots in the proper direction.. . We did an experiment in college where we put seeds on a rotating disk to throw of their gravity detection.  The seeds roots were not able to orientate themselves.. . Keep in mind that nothing in science is 100%, we only have theories.  Since nobody can ask a plant how or why they do something we can only go by our results from experiments. Thus far our experiments show that seeds are able to detect gravity and sunlight to ensure proper orientation.
3806560_13	A germinating seed can be turned upside down several times and the root will still start to bend downwards. This behaviour is an example for a tropism, a movement triggered by a stimulus.. . "It is not the soil’s humidity that causes the direction of the root, since the root will grow downwards and the shoot will grow upwards even if the plant is placed in an earth-filled tube where the upper part is moist and the lower is dry. If the plant is put into a water-filled tube the lower part of which is exposed to light while the upper is darkened, the direction of growth will still not change: a proof that it is independent of light." (A. de CANDOLLE, 1834/38). . Rather in 1806 showed the British physiologist A. KNIGHT in a decisive experiment that the direction of root growth is controlled by gravity. Shoot growth thus is mostly negatively geotropic since shoots grow upwards even in complete darkness.
3806560_20	Different plant tissues DIFFERENTIATE in the plant embryo, and each differentiated cell-tissue type is sensitive to different environmental factors at the site of seed's germination, thus different tissues will be able to grow in different directions, above soil or below.  . . When a seed germinates, the embryo sprouts a pre-root structure called the HYPOCOTYL that goes downwards, away from the air-dirt interface, so it goes deeper, away from sun and warmth and with gravity, down into the soil more deeply to help form earliest rooting structure.  A pre-leaf structure called the EPICOTYL also grows from embryo, but it grows UPWARDS towards the warmth and the light of the sun.  It might have to push thru some soil before it breaks ground, though.
